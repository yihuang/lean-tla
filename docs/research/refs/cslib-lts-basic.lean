# Labelled Transition System (LTS)

A Labelled Transition System (`LTS`) models the observable behaviour of the possible states of a
system. They are particularly popular in the fields of concurrency theory, logic, and programming
languages.

## Main definitions

- `LTS` is a structure for labelled transition systems, consisting of a labelled transition
relation `Tr` between states. We follow the style and conventions in [Sangiorgi2011].

- `LTS.MTr` extends the transition relation of any LTS to a multistep transition relation,
formalising the inference system and admissible rules for such relations in [Montesi2023].

- Definitions for all the common classes of LTSs: image-finite, finitely branching, finite-state,
finite, and deterministic.

## Main statements

- A series of results on `LTS.MTr` that allow for obtaining and composing multistep transitions in
different ways.

- `LTS.deterministic_imageFinite`: every deterministic LTS is also image-finite.

- `LTS.finiteState_imageFinite`: every finite-state LTS is also image-finite.

- `LTS.finiteState_finitelyBranching`: every finite-state LTS is also finitely-branching, if the
type of labels is finite.

Definition of a multistep transition.

(Implementation note: compared to [Montesi2023], we choose stepL instead of stepR as fundamental
rule. This makes working with lists of labels more convenient, because we follow the same
construction. It is also similar to what is done in the `SimpleGraph` library in mathlib.)
