# AVSS model notes — relationship to Canetti–Rabin '93

`Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS.lean` formalises a **threshold-faithful abstraction** of Canetti–Rabin asynchronous verifiable secret sharing. The four classical theorems
(termination, correctness, commitment, secrecy) plus reconstruction (Option C)
are all proved axiom-clean. This document records the **structural assumptions
under which those theorems hold**, the **implicit adversary model**, and the
specific **literature gaps** that any reader should be aware of when
interpreting the formalised statements.

The aim is honest disclosure: nothing here weakens the formalised theorems'
internal validity, but several distinctions matter when comparing to the AVSS
literature or when AVSS is used as a primitive for downstream protocols.

## Quick summary of the gap

| Aspect | Canetti–Rabin literature | This formalisation |
|---|---|---|
| Adversary information | Rushing — sees corrupt-coalition view + in-flight messages | **Two adversary types coexist**: plain `Adversary` (full-state access; legacy) and `RushingAdversary` (view-restricted; Phase 7.1, generic in `Adversary.lean`). The classical AVSS theorems are restated against both (Phase 7.3) |
| Adversary *power* (what corrupt parties can do/observe) | Rushing adversary controls all corrupt-party messages and observes every honest broadcast on corrupt receivers; corrupt dealer can selectively short-share honest parties; adversary may flip coins | ⚠ **Strictly weaker.** Corrupt parties cannot send echoes/readys/amplify (C1); they never receive honest echoes/readys (C2); selective non-broadcast not modelled — `dealerShare` always sends to all honest parties (C4); all theorems quantify only over deterministic adversaries (C5). C3 (dealer-share fairness) **resolved by Phase B**. See **§11**, plans in **§12 (Phase 8)** and **§13 (Phase 9)** |
| Static vs. adaptive corruption | Both treated; usually adaptive | Static (`corrupted` fixed at `μ₀` time) |
| Dealer-to-party communication | Per-party row + column polys, possibly inconsistent under corrupt dealer | Single global `s.coeffs` field; consistent by construction |
| Dealer's distribution choice | Honest = uniform of bidegree ≤ (t,t) with `f(0,0) = sec`; corrupt = adversarial | **`Polynomial.uniformBivariateWithFixedZero` is degenerate** — fixes all axis coefficients to 0, not just `f(0,0)`. Honest output equals `sec` directly (every share is `sec`), and corrupt-party row poly's constant term is `sec`. See §10 below |
| Secrecy granularity | Trace-level on corrupt parties' actual observable view | Trace-level on the **algebraic ideal grid** `bivEval coeffs ...` at non-axis points (axis points are degenerate by point above). Operational view secrecy is **vacuously true** under the degenerate distribution — see §9–§10 |
| Network model | Asynchronous with arbitrary delays, point-to-point messages | `Finset`-based in-flight queues; eventual delivery via fairness |
| Cryptographic strength | Information-theoretic | Information-theoretic (aligned in design) |

The formalisation is sound and useful as a stepping stone, but the gap between
its statements and the literature's statements is non-trivial.  Consumers of
this module should consult the relevant section below before relying on a
particular property.

✅ **Distribution refactor landed (Phase 7.7).** As of the polynomial
refactor PR (Phase 7.7), `avssInitMeasure` no longer couples to the
degenerate `Polynomial.uniformBivariateWithFixedZero`.  Instead it
uses `Polynomial.uniformBivariateFullWithFixedZero` — a true
uniform bivariate of bidegree ≤ (t, t) with **only** the `(0, 0)`
constant pinned to `sec`.  Under the new distribution
`f(α_p, 0) = sec + ∑_{i ≥ 1} coeffs(i, 0) · α_p^i` is a genuine
degree-`t` Shamir polynomial in `α_p`, so the per-party operational
content of `avss_correctness_AS`, `avss_commitment_AS`, and
`avss_reconstruction` is no longer trivially-`sec`.  The
conditional operational-secrecy theorems
(`avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional`,
`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_via_aux`)' `h_aux` becomes provable in
principle (Phase 7.4 inductive AE-bridge remains the substantive
~300–500 LOC follow-on work).  See §10 below for the per-theorem
"after refactor" semantics; §9's audit is preserved for historical
context.

## 1. Adversary model

### Literature

Canetti–Rabin and the broader AVSS literature analyse the protocol against a
**rushing adversary**.  Concretely: each round, the adversary sees

- all corrupt parties' local states,
- all messages currently in transit (including those sent this round),
- the schedule history,

and chooses, in arbitrary order:

- which messages to deliver next (asynchrony),
- what each corrupt party does this round (since the adversary controls them),
- when to corrupt new parties (in adaptive variants).

Crucially the adversary does **not** see honest parties' internal state —
only what's in messages they emit.  Secrecy claims hold against this strongest
admissible adversary.

### This formalisation

Two adversary types are now formalised side-by-side in
`Leslie/Prob/Adversary.lean`:

  * `Adversary σ ι` (legacy): a strategy
    `List (σ × Option ι) → Option ι` whose decision is conditioned on the
    full state-history.  This is the type the original M2/M3 theorems and
    PRs #25–#33 are written against, and it persists for backwards
    compatibility.

  * `RushingAdversary σ ι V` (**Phase 7.1**, generic): bundles a
    `ProtocolView σ V` (i.e. a projection `view : σ → V`) with a
    *view-restricted* schedule `List (V × Option ι) → Option ι` and a
    static corruption set.  An adapter `RushingAdversary.toAdversary`
    lifts every rushing adversary back to a plain `Adversary σ ι`,
    consulting `view` on the state-component of each history entry
    before invoking the rushing schedule.  Equivalently:
    `R.toAdversary.schedule h = R.schedule (h.map (R.view × id))`
    (rfl-simp lemma `toAdversary_schedule` in `Adversary.lean`).

The AVSS instantiation (`avssCoalitionView corr`, **Phase 7.2**, in
`AVSS.lean §19`) takes `V := corr → AVSSLocalState n t F` — the corrupt
coalition's per-party local-state projection, generalising the existing
`coalitionView` (Phase 5/6) from a size-`t` `BivariateShamir.Coalition`
to an arbitrary `Finset (Fin n)`.

Two practical consequences for downstream reasoning:

1. **Plain `Adversary` still has read access to the full state.**  This
   was already true before Phase 7 and is unchanged: the adversary's
   strategy can, in principle, branch on `s.coeffs` and on honest
   parties' `local_` fields.  Operational secrecy in the
   plain-adversary world is therefore caveated — see Phase 6's
   `avss_secrecy_AS_view` (PR #33) and its joint marginalisation with
   the schedule.

2. **`RushingAdversary` strictly restricts adversary information,
   but is also message-restricted and reception-restricted relative
   to CR.**  Under a `RushingAdversary R`, the adversary's strategy
   is — by construction — a function only of the view-history
   `(R.view of state, action)`-pairs.  It *cannot* branch on
   `s.coeffs`, on honest parties' internal state outside the view, or
   on anything else outside `corr → AVSSLocalState`.  This is the
   information half of the literature-standard rushing adversary.

   ⚠ The *capability* half is **strictly weaker than CR's**: in this
   model corrupt parties cannot send echoes/readys/amplify (C1) and
   never receive honest echoes/readys (C2).  See **§11** below for
   the full statement of these restrictions and their operational
   implication for the secrecy claim.

3. **The classical AVSS theorems re-prove against `RushingAdversary`.**
   `avss_termination_AS_fair_rushing`, `avss_correctness_AS_rushing`,
   `avss_commitment_AS_rushing` (**Phase 7.3**) are thin wrappers that
   invoke their plain-`Adversary` counterparts on `R.toAdversary`.
   Termination requires a `TrajectoryFairAdversary` witness for
   `R.toAdversary`, threaded explicitly; correctness and commitment are
   universal in the adversary so the wrapping is purely mechanical.

4. **Static corruption only.**  Unchanged from before Phase 7:
   `corr : Finset (Fin n)` is part of the initial state and never
   changes.  The standard literature reduction "static ⇒ adaptive"
   applies, so adaptive variants follow but require additional model
   machinery (corruption events).

### Implication for the formalised secrecy theorem

`avss_secrecy_AS` says: under any `Adversary`, the trace marginal of the
algebraic grid `coalitionGrid C D (ω k).1` is invariant in the secret.

This is sound because `coalitionGrid` is a function of `s.coeffs` and
`s.partyPoint` only (not of the adversary's strategy), and `s.coeffs` and
`s.partyPoint` are immutable across actions.  So the theorem doesn't actually
exercise the adversary's strategy at all — it's effectively the polynomial-
level secrecy `bivariate_shamir_secrecy` lifted through `μ₀`.

A literature-faithful operational secrecy theorem (Phases 6–7, see
"Future directions" below) requires four pieces:

- ✅ A new `RushingAdversary` type whose strategy is a function of *only* the
  corrupt-coalition view (Phase 7.1, **landed**).
- ✅ AVSS instantiation `avssCoalitionView` projecting onto corrupt
  parties' `local_` (Phase 7.2, **landed**).
- ✅ Re-proving termination / correctness / commitment against the new
  adversary type (Phase 7.3, **landed** — `*_rushing` variants of the
  classical theorems).
- ✅ A *cryptographic-core* lemma "schedule prefix factors through the
  coalition's algebraic view" (Phase 7.4, **landed**) and the
  composition `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` (Phase 7.5, **landed** —
  fully unconditional in §19.4.5; intermediates
  `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_via_aux` and
  `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_via_init_invariant` retained)
  that closes the schedule-leakage caveat from Phase 6 by discharging
  the `h_aux` hypothesis of `avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional`.  The
  proof is an inductive argument on `k` showing that, under the rushing
  adversary, the schedule at step `k+1` is a deterministic function of
  the corrupt-coalition view at steps `0..k`.  See **§9. Phase 7.4–7.5
  deferral** below for the precise statement and architectural
  rationale.
- ⏳ Replacing `s.coeffs` with per-party dealer messages (separate
  refactor; cf. §2 below) so the dealer's inputs are
  scheduling-time data, not background state (Phase 8 territory).

## 2. Dealer-to-party communication

### Literature

The dealer in Canetti–Rabin sends each party `i`:

- the row polynomial `f_i(y) = f(α_i, y)` (degree-`t` univariate in `y`),
- the column polynomial `g_i(x) = f(x, α_i)` (degree-`t` univariate in `x`).

Parties verify *consistency* via echoes: party `i` sends to each `j` the
single value `f_i(α_j)`, and `j` checks `f_i(α_j) = g_j(α_i)`.  The Bracha
echo/ready amplification is precisely how this consistency check is
distributed.  Echoes carry **payloads** (the field elements) — they're not
just control messages.

### This formalisation

`AVSSState.coeffs : Fin (t+1) → Fin (t+1) → F` is a single global field.
`partyDeliver q` writes `rowPolyOfDealer s.partyPoint s.coeffs q` (the row
polynomial) into `(s.local_ q).rowPoly`.  No column polynomial is modeled.

`partyEchoSend q` and `partyEchoReceive p q` carry **no payload** — they're
control messages that just record "q has echoed" / "p has received q's echo".
Bracha amplification fires based on counts (≥ n−t echoes received → ready
phase), not on agreement of echoed values.

### Implication

The model **trivially makes the dealer consistent**: a corrupt dealer in our
model still distributes a single coherent bivariate polynomial because there
*is* only one polynomial in the state.  Real-world AVSS verifies dealer
consistency precisely because a corrupt dealer might send different `f_i`'s
that don't fit a single bivariate polynomial — and the protocol detects this.

`avss_commitment_AS` proves "every honest output is a value of `bivEval
s.coeffs ...`".  Under our abstraction this is true by construction; the
literature's commitment theorem says something genuinely harder ("the
adversary can't fool honest parties into outputting values inconsistent with
*any* single bivariate polynomial").  See **Future directions** below for
what a faithful commitment story would require.

## 3. Honest dealer's distribution

### Literature

Honest dealer = chooses `f` uniformly at random from bidegree-`≤ (t,t)`
bivariate polynomials with `f(0,0) = sec`.  Corrupt dealer = chooses `f`
adversarially (subject only to the protocol's verifiability checks).

### This formalisation

Both the honest and corrupt dealer cases use the same `μ₀` distribution on
`s.coeffs`.  Phase 5 Layer B (`avssInitMeasure`) couples to
`uniformBivariateWithFixedZero t t sec` for both honest and corrupt cases.
The `s.dealerHonest` flag distinguishes them but doesn't change the
distribution.

### Implication

Our `avss_correctness_AS` (honest dealer ⇒ honest output = `bivEval coeffs
(partyPoint p) 0`) reads as expected.

`avss_commitment_AS` is correctly stated for any (honest or corrupt)
dealer's `coeffs` — but since `μ₀` samples uniformly in both cases, we don't
quite capture "the adversary's choice of `coeffs` was constrained by what the
protocol's verifiability allows".  The literature commitment is a *forall
adversary* statement quantifying over the dealer's input distribution; ours
is *for the fixed `μ₀` we chose*.

In a faithful refactor, the dealer's polynomial would be part of the
adversary's input (in the corrupt-dealer case), and `μ₀` would be replaced
by an adversary-chosen distribution subject to verifiability.

## 4. Secrecy granularity

### Literature

"`t`-coalition view secrecy" means: the *joint distribution* of everything
the corrupt parties observe — their local state, every message they've
received, every protocol decision they've made — is invariant in the
secret.

### This formalisation

Two distinct secrecy theorems are formalised:

- `avss_secrecy` (PR #31): polynomial-level grid form.  Distribution of the
  coalition's grid evaluations of `f` is invariant in `sec`.  Pure algebra,
  no protocol semantics.

- `avss_secrecy_AS` (PR #32, with Phase 5 Layer E step-`k` extension):
  trace-level grid form at any step `k`.  Marginal of `coalitionGrid C D (ω
  k).1` under `traceDist` is invariant in `sec`.  Crucially,
  `coalitionGrid` is the **algebraic ideal** — it's a function of `s.coeffs`
  and `s.partyPoint` only, not of corrupt parties' actual `local_`.  Since
  `s.coeffs` and `s.partyPoint` are immutable, the step-`k` and step-0
  versions agree pointwise, and both reduce to the polynomial-level theorem.

- Operational view secrecy at the corrupt-coalition's actual observable
  state (`coalitionView` projecting onto `local_` fields) is formalised
  in conditional form: `avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional` (PR #33) and
  `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_via_aux` (PR #35) both take an auxiliary
  hypothesis `h_aux` about joint marginal invariance of
  `(coalitionAlgebraicView, schedulePrefix)`.  ⚠ Under the current
  polynomial distribution this hypothesis is **provably false**; see
  §9 and §10.  The conditional theorems hold vacuously and do not
  carry useful operational content until §10's distribution refactor
  lands.

### Implication

`avss_secrecy_AS` is well-named only with the qualifier *"of the algebraic
grid view at non-axis points"*.  It's a meaningful step (it lifts the
polynomial-level secrecy through the `traceDist` infrastructure) but it
doesn't say anything about what corrupt parties *operationally* observe.
The conditional theorems that target the operational view (`coalitionView`
projecting `local_` including `rowPoly`) are vacuously true because of
§10 — the constant term of every honest party's row poly is exactly
`sec` under the current degenerate distribution, observable to any
corrupt party that runs `partyCorruptDeliver`.

The upshot: until §10 lands, **the only meaningful trace-level secrecy
statement we have is at the algebraic grid view, not the operational
local-state view**.

(Phase 7.7 has now landed §10's distribution refactor, so the
operational view-secrecy theorem `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` does
hold.  But its rushing adversary is the *view-restricted, message-
restricted, reception-restricted* one of §11 — see **§11** for what
that means concretely and why a literature-faithful version is still
Phase 8 territory.)

## 5. Network model

### Literature

Asynchronous = arbitrary message delays, but every message eventually
delivers.  Adversary controls delivery scheduling.  Echoes and readys are
point-to-point messages with adversary-controlled order.

### This formalisation

`AVSSState.inflightEchoes : Finset (Fin n × Fin n)` and `inflightReady :
Finset (Fin n)` are abstracted as **sets** of pending messages.  Schedule
fairness (`avssFair`) models eventual-delivery: under fair scheduling, every
in-transit message is eventually delivered.

### Implication

Two minor abstractions:

- **Set, not multiset.**  Real networks allow message duplication.  For AVSS
  this doesn't matter (semantics are idempotent — `partyEchoReceive p q`
  is no-op if `q ∈ (s.local_ p).echoesReceived`), but it's a quiet
  simplification.

- **Order.**  Sets are unordered; real networks have arbitrary delivery
  order, which the schedule abstracts.  Our model captures this via the
  adversary's free choice of which `partyEchoReceive p q` action to fire
  next — equivalent in the limit.

Network model is the most faithful aspect of the abstraction.

## 6. Cryptographic setting

### Literature

Two branches:

- **Information-theoretic AVSS** (Canetti–Rabin '93): unconditional
  guarantees, no cryptographic assumptions.
- **Computational AVSS** (Pedersen, AVSS-via-commitments, etc.):
  game-based proofs against polynomial-time adversaries.

### This formalisation

Information-theoretic (aligned with Canetti–Rabin).  All theorems are
unconditional.

### Implication

Aligned with the Canetti–Rabin branch.  Computational AVSS would require a
different machinery (game-based reductions, polynomial-time adversary
restrictions) that our framework doesn't provide.

## 7. Reconstruction agency

### Literature

Reconstruction is performed by parties cooperating: they exchange shares,
run Lagrange interpolation, detect cheating during reconstruction.

### This formalisation

`avss_reconstruction` (Option C) is a math-level theorem: given `t+1`
honest shares with distinct `partyPoint`s, Lagrange returns `s.coeffs 0 0`.
There's no operational reconstruction phase modeled.

### Implication

Standard abstraction (similar to many other formalisations).  A faithful
reconstruction phase would add new actions to `AVSSAction` (e.g.,
`partyShareSend`, `partyReconstruct`).  Probably ~100 LOC; the cryptographic
content is already in the algebra so the operational lift is mostly
plumbing.

## What's *correctly* captured

Lest the above read as a litany of caveats, here's what the formalisation
*does* nail down rigorously:

- **Termination under fairness**: `avss_termination_AS_fair`, reduced to
  the structural sublevel-finite-variant rule, axiom-clean.  This holds
  against *any* adversary in our model — the strongest admissible since
  termination is a liveness property unaffected by adversary information.

- **Per-party share computation**: `avss_correctness_AS` rigorously proves
  that for an honest dealer, every honest output is `bivEval s.coeffs
  (s.partyPoint p) 0`.  This is the actual Canetti–Rabin specification (vs.
  the simpler `coeffs 0 0` rule used in `AVSSAbstract.lean`).

- **Output-determined-by-coeffs**: `avss_commitment_AS` proves that *given
  our model*, every honest output is determined by `s.coeffs` regardless of
  dealer honesty.  Useful for downstream reasoning that consumes AVSS
  abstractly (without caring about dealer-side malice).

- **Reconstruction algebra**: `avss_reconstruction` is a clean Lagrange
  interpolation theorem.  Stands as a mathematical fact independent of the
  protocol model.

- **Polynomial-level secrecy**: `avss_secrecy` (and the trace-lifted
  `avss_secrecy_AS`) cleanly reduces to `BivariateShamir.bivariate_shamir_-
  secrecy` — the cryptographic core is preserved.

- **Operational μ₀ coupling** (Phase 5 Layer B): `avssInitMeasure` couples
  the protocol's initial state distribution to
  `uniformBivariateWithFixedZero t t sec`.  This is the structural anchor
  for any future stronger secrecy theorem.

- **Algebraic-grid invariance under all actions** (Phase 5):
  `avssStep_coalitionGrid_invariant`.  This is the key structural fact that
  enables the step-`k` lift.

## 9. Phase 7.4–7.5 partial closure — schedule-leakage closing theorem

### What Phases 7.4–7.5 deliver

Phase 7 closes the rushing-adversary *type machinery* and classical-
theorem wrappers (Phases 7.1–7.3, **landed**) plus the schedule-leakage
half of the headline (this section, **landed**):

  * **Phase 7.4 simulate machinery (landed).** AVSS.lean §19.2
    introduces `avssSimulateRev`, `avssSimulateTrace`, and
    `avssSimulateNext`: a deterministic per-step simulation of the
    AVSS trace under a `RushingAdversary` whose effects are
    `PMF.pure` and whose schedule is a deterministic function of the
    view-history.  Plus structural lemmas: list length, head, succ
    recurrence, `avssSimulateRev_reverse_eq_ofFn` (index-form
    characterisation matching `FinPrefix.toList`).
  * **Phase 7.4 inductive AE-bridge (landed).** AVSS.lean §19.2.4
    proves `traceDist_AE_eq_avssSimulateTrace`: under `R.toAdversary`,
    every step's trace AE-equals `avssSimulateTrace R (ω 0).1` at
    that step.  Threads the marginal recurrence
    `Kernel.map_frestrictLe_trajMeasure_compProd_eq_map_trajMeasure`
    through the per-step Dirac kernel (each branch is Dirac by
    `PMF.pure` on the effect side and by Dirac on stutter branches),
    using a strong induction-form
    `traceDist_AE_eq_avssSimulateTrace_strong` over the entire
    prefix.  Per-prefix Dirac-identification lemma
    `avssSpec_R_stepKernel_AE_simulate` factors the kernel through
    the simulate's `avssSimulateNext` under prefix-matching
    hypothesis.
  * **Phase 7.4 joint factoring (landed).** AVSS.lean §19.2.5 defines
    `simAlgebraicView` and `simSchedulePrefix` as deterministic
    functions of `s_0`, then proves
    `coalitionAlgebraicView_schedulePrefix_AE_eq_sim` (AE form) and
    `traceDist_algebraicView_schedulePrefix_factors_AE` (pushforward
    form).  Combined with the step-0 state marginal
    (`traceDist_step_zero_state_marginal`, PR #32), expresses the
    trace-level joint marginal as a pushforward of the initial
    measure through `(simAlgebraicView, simSchedulePrefix)` —
    `traceDist_jointMarginal_eq_init` (§19.4).
  * **Phase 7.5 (thin composition, landed).** AVSS.lean §19.3
    introduces `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_via_aux`, a thin wrapper
    around PR #33's `avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional` that plugs in
    `R.toAdversary` for the underlying adversary.  Hypothesis
    `h_aux` (trace-level joint marginal invariance) is reduced to
    `h_init_invariant` (initial-measure pushforward invariance) via
    `traceDist_algebraicView_schedulePrefix_invariant` (§19.4).
  * **Phase 7.4 headline (landed).** AVSS.lean §19.4 introduces
    `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_via_init_invariant`, taking
    `h_init_invariant` (a polynomial-level initial-measure
    invariance) as a hypothesis instead of the abstract trace-level
    `h_aux`.  Composed with the row-poly secrecy lemma, §19.4.5
    discharges `h_init_invariant` and yields the canonical
    fully-unconditional headline `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing`.

### What's still deferred (algebraic-core row-poly secrecy)

The single piece remaining for a fully unconditional headline:

  * **Algebraic-core row-poly secrecy (~+200 LOC).**  The
    polynomial-manipulation strengthening of
    `BivariateShamir.bivariate_shamir_secrecy_full` that lifts the
    grid-pointwise theorem (sec-invariant for `|C| × |D|`
    bivariate-evaluations with `|C|, |D| ≤ t`) to a *row-poly*
    form (sec-invariant for `|S|` row polynomials at corrupt
    coalition `S` with `|S| ≤ t`, each row poly a `Fin (t+1) → F`
    vector of coefficients).  This is what's needed for
    `(simAlgebraicView, simSchedulePrefix)`'s initial-measure
    pushforward to be sec-invariant.

    Concretely: under `uniformBivariateFullWithFixedZero t t sec`
    (PR #36), for any `S : Finset (Fin n)` with `S.card ≤ t` and
    `partyPoint` avoiding zero, the joint distribution of
    `(rowPolyOfDealer partyPoint (polyToCoeffs f) q)_{q ∈ S}` is
    uniform on `S → Fin (t+1) → F` — and hence sec-invariant.
    Sketch: decompose `uniformBivariateFullWithFixedZero` into
    independent column polynomials `g_l(x)` for `l ∈ Fin (t+1)`;
    `g_0` has Shamir-secret structure with secret `sec` (uniform
    by `evals_uniform`), `g_l` for `l ≥ 1` is fully uniform.
    Combine via product-of-uniforms.

    Modular composition: when this lemma lands as a separate PR,
    `h_init_invariant` becomes provable via
    `traceDist_jointMarginal_eq_init` plus the row-poly secrecy
    plus the structural fact that `(simAlgebraicView,
    simSchedulePrefix)` factors through `(rowPolyOfDealer at corr)`
    (provable via simulate's view-history-only dependence).

This piece has landed (`bivariate_shamir_secrecy_rowPoly_full`),
discharging `h_init_invariant` and yielding the canonical
literature-faithful operational secrecy theorem
`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` under the AVSS state model —
completing Phase 7.

### Why "row-poly secrecy" is *structurally false* under the current distribution (audit, 2026-05-04)

A direct attempt to discharge `h_aux` under the current AVSS
distribution **cannot succeed**, and the obstruction is at the
distribution-design level, not the proof-engineering level.  Recording
the audit here so a future attempt does not repeat it.

**Observation.**
`Polynomial.uniformBivariateWithFixedZero t t sec` (the distribution
that `avssInitMeasure` couples to) is **not** the standard "uniform
polynomial of bidegree ≤ (t, t) with `f(0, 0) = sec`".  Its def at
`Leslie/Prob/Polynomial.lean:247–253` is:

```
(PMF.uniform (Fin dx → Fin dy → F)).map fun coefs =>
    Polynomial.C (Polynomial.C s) +
      ∑ i : Fin dx, ∑ j : Fin dy,
        Polynomial.C (Polynomial.C (coefs i j)) *
          Polynomial.X ^ (i.val + 1) *
          (Polynomial.C Polynomial.X) ^ (j.val + 1)
```

Every monomial in the sum has both `X`-degree `≥ 1` *and* `Y`-degree
`≥ 1`.  So all "axis" coefficients are forced to zero except the
constant `(0, 0)` — which is `sec`.  Concretely:

  * `coeffs(0, 0) = sec`
  * `coeffs(k, 0) = 0` for every `k ≥ 1`
  * `coeffs(0, l) = 0` for every `l ≥ 1`
  * `coeffs(k, l)` for `k, l ≥ 1` is uniform random

Equivalently, `f(x, 0) = sec` for **all** `x`, and symmetrically
`f(0, y) = sec`.  This is why `Polynomial.bivariate_evals_uniform`
carries the `0 ∉ pts_x ∪ pts_y` precondition: the axes are constants
of `sec`, not uniformly distributed, and the proof's
`step1 ∘ step2` factoring relies on the off-axis-only structure.

**Consequence for `coalitionAlgebraicView.1`.**
`rowPolyOfDealer pp coeffs p l = ∑_k coeffs(k, l) · pp(p)^k`.  At
`l = 0` this evaluates to

```
rowPolyOfDealer pp coeffs p 0 = coeffs(0, 0) + ∑_{k ≥ 1} coeffs(k, 0) · pp(p)^k = sec
```

— **identically `sec` for every party `p`**.  Hence the `l = 0` row of
`(coalitionAlgebraicView C ω k).1` is `Dirac (sec, sec, …, sec)` and

```
(traceDist sec).map (fun ω => coalitionAlgebraicView C ω k)
≠
(traceDist sec').map (fun ω => coalitionAlgebraicView C ω k)
   for sec ≠ sec'
```

so `h_aux` of `avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional` is **false** under
the current distribution whenever `sec ≠ sec'`.  The conclusion of
the conditional is also false (since the operational `coalitionView`
stores the full `rowPoly`, including the leaked `sec` constant).
The conditional theorem holds vacuously (its hypothesis is false),
not as a discharge target.

**The fix is in the distribution, not the proof.**
A literature-faithful row-poly secrecy needs:

  1. A **true** uniform bivariate `f` of bidegree ≤ (t, t) with the
     single constraint `f(0, 0) = sec` — i.e., all `(t + 1)² − 1`
     other coefficients independently uniform in `F`.  Under that
     distribution `f(x, 0)` is a Shamir polynomial in `x` with secret
     `sec`, so by univariate Shamir secrecy `(f(x_p, 0))_{p ∈ corr}`
     for `corr.card ≤ t` and distinct nonzero `partyPoint`s has
     sec-invariant marginal — the row poly's constant is no longer
     constant-`sec`.
  2. Re-prove `bivariate_evals_uniform` under that distribution.  The
     existing factoring (`step1 ∘ step2`) does not apply; a
     Vandermonde + Lagrange argument does.
  3. Re-prove `BivariateShamir.bivariate_shamir_secrecy_pts` against
     the new distribution (it currently calls
     `bivariate_evals_uniform` directly).
  4. Migrate `avssInitState ∘ polyToCoeffs` to the new distribution
     so `s.coeffs` carries the random axis coefficients (which then
     propagate into `rowPolyOfDealer p 0`).

**Scope.**
Step 1 lives in `Leslie/Prob/Polynomial.lean` (owned).
Step 2 lives in `Leslie/Prob/Polynomial.lean` (owned).
Step 3 lives in `Leslie/Examples/Prob/BivariateShamir.lean`
(**read-only** per the worker brief), so completing the chain in a
single PR violates the constraint.  An additive path that adds
`uniformBivariateFullWithFixedZero` and a parallel proof family
without modifying `BivariateShamir.lean` is feasible (≈ 250–400 LOC)
but lives in parallel to the existing infrastructure and requires a
separate `avssInitMeasureFull` plus an alternate conditional /
headline; it has not been pursued in this PR-set.

**Bottom line.**
The "+200 LOC algebraic-core" deferral cannot be discharged purely
inside `BivariateShamir.bivariate_shamir_secrecy`'s grid form: the
row-poly form is provably false under the current distribution, and
the fix requires a distribution change that crosses an off-limits
file.  Either the worker brief's read-only constraint on
`BivariateShamir.lean` needs to be lifted, or the additive
parallel-distribution path described above needs to be sanctioned,
before this work item can be closed.

### Original deferral (kept for context)

The original deferral note from before this PR-set is preserved in
the project's git history; the precise statement of what was deferred
and the proof outline below still apply to the remaining work.

### Precise statement of the gap

PR #33's `avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional` (Phase 6.3) discharges the
operational view-secrecy theorem *given* a hypothesis

```
h_aux :
  (traceDist sec).map (fun ω => (coalitionAlgebraicView C ω k, schedulePrefix ω k)) =
  (traceDist sec').map (fun ω => (coalitionAlgebraicView C ω k, schedulePrefix ω k))
```

i.e. the joint marginal of (algebraic-coalition view, schedule prefix)
at step `k` is invariant in the secret.  Under a plain `Adversary`,
`h_aux` is **not unconditionally true** — the adversary's strategy may
branch on `s.coeffs` and thereby leak `sec`-bits via its scheduling
decisions, so the joint marginal can differ between `sec` and `sec'`.

Under a `RushingAdversary R` with `R.toAdversary` plugged into
`traceDist`, the schedule is by construction a deterministic function
of the corrupt-coalition view-history.  Combined with Phase 6.2's
bridge (corrupt local states factor through `algebraicView`) and
Phase 5 step-`k` algebraic-view secrecy, this forces `h_aux` to hold.
The theorem `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_via_aux` then follows by
`apply avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional`; composition with the
initial-measure invariance (§19.4) and the row-poly secrecy lemma
(§19.4.5) yields the canonical fully-unconditional
`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing`.

### Why the proof is non-trivial

The composition outlined above looks short, but the underlying
factoring lemma "the schedule prefix at step `k` AE-equals a
deterministic function of the algebraic-coalition view at step `k`"
(Phase 7.4's substantive form) is a genuine inductive argument on `k`
threaded through the Ionescu–Tulcea trace-measure construction.
Concretely:

  * At each step `i < k` the action that fires is
    `R.toAdversary.schedule (history)` gated by
    `(spec.actions ·).gate (state at step i)`.
  * The rushing-restricted schedule depends only on view = corrupt
    local states (Phase 7.1's structural lemma).
  * Phase 6.2's bridge (`coalitionView_corrupt_factors_AE`) shows
    corrupt local states are determined by the algebraic view AE.
  * AVSS gates (after inspection) do *not* depend on `s.coeffs` —
    they read state-flags (`delivered`, `echoSent`, `dealerSent`,
    etc.) plus `partyPoint` / `dealerHonest` / `corrupted`, all
    invariant under sec.  Thus gate evaluation factors through the
    non-secret state evolution, which itself factors through schedule
    history.

Putting these together via the Phase 5 inductive template (the
`Kernel.map_frestrictLe_trajMeasure_compProd_eq_map_trajMeasure`
recurrence used in `traceDist_coalitionGrid_AE_eq_init`) yields the
desired AE-factoring.  Conservatively this is ~300–500 LOC of
inductive proof plus auxiliary measurability and state-evolution
plumbing.

### Path forward

The deferred work is well-defined: the proof outline above identifies
all the structural ingredients, every one of which is already
formalised in the current branch.  The remaining work is *only*
inductive-proof engineering, with no new cryptographic content to
discover.  A follow-up PR should:

  1. Define `nonSecretState` (the state projection excluding
     `s.coeffs`) and an induction-friendly evolution lemma.
  2. State `RushingAdversary.schedulePrefix_factors_through_view_AE`
     in `AVSS.lean` (or a new `Leslie/Prob/RushingAdversary.lean`
     file) using the algebraic-view type.
  3. Prove by induction on `k` using the Phase 5 template.
  4. Compose with PR #33's `avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional` to
     deliver `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` — the literature-faithful
     operational secrecy theorem.

This unblocks the headline operational-secrecy theorem; once landed,
the only remaining gap (relative to a literature-faithful AVSS) is
per-party dealer messages (§2 above) — the classical "row + column
secrecy" formulation which `BivariateShamir`'s deferred +200 LOC
polynomial-manipulation work will eventually supply.

## 10. Distribution refactor (✅ landed Phase 7.7)

§9's audit identified that `Polynomial.uniformBivariateWithFixedZero`
is degenerate — every random monomial has both `X`-degree ≥ 1 and
`Y`-degree ≥ 1, forcing all axis coefficients to zero and making
`f(x, 0) = sec` for all `x`.  This blocked the operational-view
secrecy story at the polynomial level.

This section records the **distribution refactor** that
unblocked the chain (now landed as Phase 7.7).

### Target distribution

```lean
noncomputable def uniformBivariateFullWithFixedZero (dx dy : ℕ) (s : F) :
    PMF (Polynomial (Polynomial F)) :=
  -- (PMF.uniform (Fin (dx+1) → Fin (dy+1) → F)).map fun coefs =>
  --   ∑ i, ∑ j,
  --     Polynomial.C (Polynomial.C (if (i, j) = (0, 0) then s else coefs i j))
  --       * X^i.val * (C X)^j.val
  ...
```

i.e., a true uniform bidegree-`(dx, dy)` bivariate polynomial with
**only the `(0, 0)` coefficient pinned to `s`** and all other
`(dx + 1) * (dy + 1) - 1` coefficients independently uniform.

Under this distribution, `f(α_p, 0) = ∑_k coeffs(k, 0) · α_p^k` is a
genuine degree-`dx` Shamir polynomial in `α_p` with constant term
`coeffs(0, 0) = s`.  For any `t` distinct nonzero evaluation points
`(α_p)_{p ∈ corr}` with `corr.card ≤ t`, univariate Shamir secrecy
gives that the marginal `(f(α_p, 0))_{p ∈ corr}` is sec-invariant.

### Refactor plan (~360 LOC, 4 commits — ✅ all landed)

| Step | File | LOC | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Added `uniformBivariateFullWithFixedZero` (3-product source: interior matrix + axisX vector + axisY vector) | `Leslie/Prob/Polynomial.lean` | ~40 | ✅ |
| 2. Proved `bivariate_evals_uniform_full` (joint eval at off-axis grid uniform on `pts_x → pts_y → F`).  Reduces to existing `bivariate_evals_uniform dx dy 0` plus translation invariance: the new polynomial decomposes as `s + α(axisX)(p) + β(axisY)(q) + γ(coefs)(p, q)`, with γ exactly the eval of the axis-zero distribution at constant 0 | `Leslie/Prob/Polynomial.lean` | ~290 | ✅ |
| 3. Added `bivariate_shamir_secrecy_pts_full` and `bivariate_shamir_secrecy_full` against the new distribution | `Leslie/Examples/Prob/BivariateShamir.lean` | ~90 | ✅ |
| 4. Migrated `avssInitPMF` to use `uniformBivariateFullWithFixedZero`; added `bivEval_polyToCoeffs_eq_eval_of_support_full` bridge; updated `avss_secrecy_initPMF` and `avss_secrecy` to consume `bivariate_shamir_secrecy_full` | `Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS.lean` | ~280 | ✅ |

### What changed after the refactor

| Theorem | Before refactor (axis-zero distribution) | After refactor (full distribution) |
|---|---|---|
| `avss_correctness_AS` | honest output = `bivEval coeffs (pp p) 0`, collapsed to `sec` for all `p` (degenerate) | honest output = `bivEval coeffs (pp p) 0`, the *per-party Shamir share* — different `p` get different shares |
| `avss_commitment_AS` | every honest output = `coeffs 0 0` (collapsed) | every honest output = `bivEval coeffs (pp p) 0` (per-party share) |
| `avss_reconstruction` | trivial since all shares = `sec` | genuine Lagrange interpolation: `t + 1` distinct shares recover `coeffs 0 0` (and reconstruction across fewer shares is information-theoretically impossible by Shamir secrecy) |
| `avss_secrecy` | grid form at non-axis points; meaningful but doesn't say anything about axis row-poly contents | unchanged shape (still the polynomial-level grid form), now reads as the foundational ingredient for operational secrecy.  Statement migrated to `uniformBivariateFullWithFixedZero` |
| `avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional` / `_rushing` | vacuously true (`h_aux` provably false) | **conditional theorem unchanged**, but `h_aux` now becomes provable in principle.  Discharging it remains Phase 7.4 inductive AE-bridge (~300–500 LOC follow-on) |

### Phase 7.4 inductive AE-bridge (still required)

Even after the distribution refactor, the inductive AE-bridge proof
sketched in §9's "Path forward" remains: the proof that under a
`RushingAdversary`, the schedule prefix at step `k` AE-equals a
deterministic function of the algebraic-coalition view at step `k`.
This proof was Phase 7.4's substantive form; it consumes the
simulate machinery (PR #35 commit `39b24d0`).  Estimated ~300–500
additional LOC of inductive trace plumbing.

### History (now superseded by the landed refactor)

The original Phase 7 worker brief made `BivariateShamir.lean`
read-only.  The worker correctly stopped at the boundary and
recorded the finding (commit `2de1f2b`) rather than violate the
constraint.  Phase 7.7's worker received explicit authorisation
to modify `BivariateShamir.lean` for the duration of the
distribution refactor; the parallel-additive path was chosen
(both `uniformBivariateWithFixedZero` and
`uniformBivariateFullWithFixedZero` coexist) so that `SyncVSS.lean`
and `AVSSAbstract.lean` (off-limits) continue to consume the
axis-zero variant unchanged.

## 11. Adversary-power restrictions (relative to CR '93)

§1 documents the *information* the rushing adversary may use (a
projection of the state).  This section documents three orthogonal
restrictions on what the adversary can *do* and *observe* in this
state model.  They are not bugs in the formalisation — every theorem
is sound about the model it speaks of — but they weaken the implicit
adversary relative to Canetti–Rabin '93, and a reader who cites the
formalised secrecy / commitment / termination theorems without
consulting them risks overclaiming.

The shorthand C1, C2, C3 is used in theorem docstrings
(`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing`, `avss_correctness_AS`,
`avss_commitment_AS`, `avss_termination_AS_fair`) when pointing at
this section.

### 11.1. C1 — Corrupt parties cannot send echoes/readys/amplify

✅ **Resolved by the Phase 8.5b chain** (PRs #57 / #59 / #60 / #61 /
#62 / #63 / #64 / #65 / #66).  The honest gates on
`partyEchoSend` / `partyReady` / `partyAmplify` were dropped, the
`partyEchoSend` broadcast filter was widened to all parties, and
`corruptLocalInv` was weakened to its sustainable two-clause form
(`output = none`, `(delivered = false → rowPoly = none)`).  The
`avssCert` `V_super` / `V_super_fair` / `U_dec_det` disjuncts now
dispatch via `Or.inr` for corrupt-fired actions through the new
liveness lemma `avssFairActionEnabled_at_non_terminated`, and the
soundness route of `avss_termination_AS_fair` was switched from
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det` (requires `TrajectoryUMono`,
false under C1+C2) to the BC running-min route
`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_bc_of_running_min_drops`.

**Resolution status (citation).**

| PR | Role |
|---|---|
| **#57** (8.5a) | `s.dealerSent = true` gate strengthening on send actions (variant prep). |
| **#59** (8.5b-framework) | `V_super` disjunct in `FairASTCertificate`. |
| **#60** (8.5b-α) | C1+C2 model surgery + `corruptLocalInv` weakening + cert sorries. |
| **#61** (8.5b-β) | `avssFairActionEnabled_at_non_terminated` cert dispatch. |
| **#62** (8.5b-γ) | `avssFreshInv` + `actionGate_iff` + `simSyncInv` re-derivation. |
| **#63** (8.5b-γ-followup) | C5/C7 stuck-cases via `avssFlowInv` joint invariant + `(h_corr : corr.card ≤ t)`. |
| **#64** (8.5b-γ-followup-2) | F4 ready-flow preservation via per-pair `inflightReady : Finset (Fin n × Fin n)`. |
| **#65** (8.5b-δ) | BC running-min termination route switch. |
| **#66** (8.5c) | `coalitionView_corrupt_factors_AE` weakening (drop schedule-dependent clauses). |

**(Pre-resolution history kept below for context.)**

Every send-action's gate has `p ∉ s.corrupted` (see
`Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS.lean`):

  * `partyEchoSend p` (gate, line ~401–403): `p ∉ s.corrupted`.
  * `partyReady p` (gate, line ~407–410): `p ∉ s.corrupted`.
  * `partyAmplify p` (gate, line ~411–414): `p ∉ s.corrupted`.

Consequence: in this model, corrupt parties' only protocol-relevant
action is `partyCorruptDeliver` (passively receive their row poly
from the dealer).  They cannot inject echoes, fake readys, equivocate,
or amplify — every protocol message they would emit is gate-blocked.

In CR '93 the rushing adversary controls *what* corrupt parties send,
including malformed and adversarially-timed messages designed to
manipulate honest threshold counts (e.g., racing an echo so that an
honest party's `echoesReceived` reaches `n − t` from a corrupt-only
quorum).

**Implication.**

  * For *termination/correctness/commitment*, this makes the
    formalised theorems strictly stronger than the literature: the
    adversary has fewer disruption options, so any property proved
    holds against a (proper) restriction of the CR adversary.
  * For *secrecy*, the implication runs the other way: a proof of
    secrecy in this model is against a *strictly weaker* adversary
    than CR's, so it does **not** directly imply CR-rushing secrecy.

**Bridge to literature.**  Phase 8 (per-party dealer messages and
adversary-controlled corrupt-party send schedule) replaces these
gates with adversary-chosen send actions subject to message-format
verifiability.

**Phase 8.4 status (2026-05-05).**  C1 closure was originally scoped
into Phase 8.4 but deferred during implementation: dropping the honest
gates on `partyEchoSend` / `partyReady` / `partyAmplify` invalidates
the K-weighted variant's strict-decrease story (corrupt-fired sends do
not consume honest-only `unsentEchoSet` slots), and would also force
weakening `corruptLocalInv` (whose `echoesReceived = ∅ ∧ readyReceived = ∅`
clauses underpin the Phase 6/7 secrecy proofs).  Both are
interdependent state-machine refactors and warrant their own PR.
Phase 8.4 instead delivered the **cryptographic content** (Vandermonde-
uniqueness witness for `joinedConsistencyInv`'s preservation, see §12.1
row 8.4); C1 is queued for Phase 8.5+ alongside the variant rework
and the secrecy chain re-verification.

**Phase 8.5 subdivision (2026-05-05).**  An attempt to land C1 (along
with C2 + C4) in a single Phase 8.5 PR confirmed the original
~400 LOC estimate but surfaced cascade depth that makes a single PR
practically infeasible; the work has been subdivided into
8.5a/b/c/d (see §12.1).  C1 closure proper is **PR 8.5b** (combined
with C2), preceded by **PR 8.5a** (variant analysis preparation:
`s.dealerSent = true` gate strengthening + `unsentEchoSet`/
`notReadySentSet` extension to corrupt parties).

**Phase 8.5b PROPER attempt (2026-05-06).**  A worker attempt to
land 8.5b (C1 + C2 model surgery, `corruptLocalInv` weakening,
`avssCert` `Or.inr` dispatch for corrupt fires, and BC running-min
termination route switch) in a single PR validated the original
plan's correctness but found the empirical scope to be ~600–1000 LOC
— 3–5× the ~200 LOC estimate.  The cascade has three distinct
stages that **must land together** to remain build-green at the
cert level (stages i + ii) and through the secrecy theorem
statements (stage iii):

  1. **Model surgery** (gate drops, broadcast-filter broadening,
     `corruptLocalInv` weakening, per-action `_lt` lemma adaptations,
     dispatcher rename) — ~250 LOC.  Saved as a captured WIP diff at
     `/tmp/AVSS-phase8-5b-WIP.patch` (worker session 2026-05-06).
  2. **Cert `Or.inr` dispatch** in `avssCert.V_super`/
     `V_super_fair`/`U_dec_det` for corrupt-fired actions, requiring
     a new ~150 LOC AVSS-side liveness lemma:
     `avssFairActionEnabled_at_non_terminated` (at any state with
     `avssTermInv ∧ ¬ terminated`, some fair action is enabled —
     this is the AVSS progress witness that the V_super disjunct
     framework expects).  Bundled with stage 1 to keep the build
     green at the cert level.
  3. **`coalitionView_corrupt_factors_AE` statement weakening** —
     drop the four schedule-dependent clauses, retain only the
     `coeffs`-content conclusion.  Cascades through ~6+ secrecy-chain
     consumers that destructure the old 6-tuple.  This is a smaller
     prerequisite carved out of 8.5c's original scope.

The BC running-min termination route switch (originally bundled
into 8.5b) and the deeper secrecy-chain re-proof through
`coalitionTrivialView` (originally 8.5c) are *not* required for
the build-green minimum — they're orthogonal and can land
independently.  See §12.1 rows 8.5b-i/ii/iii for the refined
subdivision.

C1 closure properly lands when 8.5b-i + 8.5b-ii are bundled.

### 11.2. C2 — Honest echoes/readys are addressed only to honest receivers

✅ **Resolved by the Phase 8.5b chain** (PRs #60 / #62 / #66).  The
`partyEchoReceive` and `partyReceiveReady` honest-receiver gates were
dropped jointly with the C1 surgery (PR #60), and the
`coalitionView_corrupt_factors_AE` statement was weakened (PR #66) to
drop the four schedule-dependent clauses (`echoSent`,
`echoesReceived`, `readySent`, `readyReceived`), retaining only the
`coeffs`-content clauses (`output = none`,
`delivered = false → rowPoly = none`,
`delivered = true → rowPoly = some (rowPolyOfDealer …)`).  The
`coalitionTraceView_eq_reconstruct_AE` consumer chain (PRs #62, #66)
was rebuilt under the wider corrupt-local view; the cTV bridge now
fires uniformly via `coalitionRowPolyAlignedInv` (a structural,
honest-dealer-INDEPENDENT alignment invariant introduced in
8.5d-β-followup-7).

**Resolution status (citation).**

| PR | Role |
|---|---|
| **#60** (8.5b-α) | Drop `partyEchoReceive` / `partyReceiveReady` honest-receiver gates; widen `partyEchoSend` broadcast filter to all parties. |
| **#62** (8.5b-γ) | `simSyncInv` re-derivation under wider broadcast image. |
| **#66** (8.5c) | `coalitionView_corrupt_factors_AE` weakening; secrecy-chain consumer cascade. |

**(Pre-resolution history kept below for context.)**

`partyEchoSend p`'s effect (around line 348 of `AVSS.lean`) populates
`inflightEchoes` only with `(p, q)` for `q ∉ s.corrupted` (the
`Finset.filter` excludes corrupt receivers).  The receive gates
`partyEchoReceive p q` and `partyReceiveReady p q` additionally
require `p ∉ s.corrupted`.  Symmetrically for `partyReady`.

Consequence: no honest-to-corrupt echo or ready is ever in transit,
and corrupt parties never receive any echo or ready from honest
parties.  Their `(s.local_ p).echoesReceived` and `readyReceived`
fields remain empty throughout every reachable trace.

In CR '93, honest broadcasts are point-to-point messages that go to
*every* party including corrupt ones.  The corrupt-coalition view in
CR therefore includes "I have received an echo from honest p" /
"honest q has readied" — which is a real information channel that
the adversary can use both to learn about honest progress and to
correlate scheduling decisions.

**Implication.**  Combined with C1, the corrupt-coalition view in
this model essentially reduces to:

> for each corrupt `p`, has `partyCorruptDeliver` fired? if so, here
> is `rowPolyOfDealer s.partyPoint s.coeffs p`.

That is a much smaller view than CR's.  This is why
`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing`'s rushing adversary, while
view-restricted in the §1 sense, still carries the qualifier "under
the AVSS state model" — the model has carved out the operational
channels through which a CR-rushing adversary would observe honest
broadcasts on corrupt receivers.

**Bridge to literature.**  Same as C1: Phase 8's per-party messages
refactor closes both C1 and C2 simultaneously by giving the adversary
full delivery scheduling on every honest message including those
addressed to corrupt receivers.

**Phase 8.4 status (2026-05-05).**  C2 closure was scoped into Phase
8.4 but deferred for the same reason as C1: dropping the
`partyEchoReceive` honest-receiver gate (and widening the
`partyEchoSend` broadcast filter to all parties) would create
`(honest, corrupt)` entries in `inflightEchoes` whose drainage feeds
into `(s.local_ p).echoesReceived` for corrupt `p` — directly
invalidating `corruptLocalInv`'s `echoesReceived = ∅` clause and
breaking Phase 6/7's coalition-view structural theorem.  Resolving
this requires re-engineering the corrupt-local invariant (or
introducing a separate "corrupt receiver buffer" that doesn't feed
into the secrecy view), which is a substantial state-machine
refactor.  C2 is queued for Phase 8.5+ alongside C1.

**Phase 8.5 subdivision (2026-05-05).**  C2 closure is **PR 8.5b**
(combined with C1).  The technical resolution route surfaced during
the Phase 8.5 attempt is the **`coalitionTrivialView` factoring**:
treat the schedule-dependent `(echoSent, echoesReceived, readySent,
readyReceived)` fields of corrupt parties as a separate per-step
projection of the trace (independent of `coeffs`), and update
`buildCorruptLocalState`/`reconstructCoalitionTraceView` to take it
as a parameter alongside the algebraic view.  This cascades through
`coalitionTraceView_eq_reconstruct_AE` and the headline
secrecy-conditional theorem `avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional`, which
takes a richer `h_aux` covering the joint marginal of
`(coalitionAlgebraicView, coalitionTrivialView, schedulePrefix)`.
The `simAlgebraicView`/`simSchedulePrefix` factoring chain (§19.4)
gains a parallel `simTrivialView` deterministic-in-`(s_0, schedule)`
companion, and the headline `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` reroutes
through it.  Mechanical once 8.5b lands; **PR 8.5c** delivers the
secrecy chain re-proof.

**Phase 8.5b PROPER attempt (2026-05-06).**  Same status as C1: see
§11.1's 2026-05-06 follow-up note.  C2 closure lands together with
C1 in 8.5b-i + 8.5b-ii (the model-surgery + cert-`Or.inr`-dispatch
bundle); the secrecy-chain consumer statements (which currently
destructure `corruptLocalInv`'s `echoesReceived = ∅ ∧ readyReceived
= ∅` clauses) are weakened in 8.5b-iii.  The `coalitionTrivialView`
introduction and full secrecy re-proof remain in 8.5c per the
original 2026-05-05 plan.

### 11.3. C3 — `dealerShare` is not in `avssFairActions`

`avssFairActions` (definition at `AVSS.lean` line ~568) explicitly
lists only honest-party receive/send/output actions:

```
def avssFairActions : Set (AVSSAction n F) :=
  { a | match a with
        | .partyDeliver _ | .partyEchoSend _ | .partyEchoReceive _ _
        | .partyReady _ | .partyAmplify _ | .partyReceiveReady _ _
        | .partyOutput _ => True
        | _ => False }
```

**(Pre-Phase-B history, kept for context.)** Pre-Phase-B,
`dealerShare` and `partyCorruptDeliver` both fell into the catch-all
`_ => False` and were not fair-required.

Consequence (pre-Phase-B): a "fair adversary" was *not required* to
ever fire `dealerShare`.  A stalling adversary that never fired it
kept `s.dealerSent = false` forever; every fair action's gate then
failed (`partyDeliver` requires `s.dealerSent = true`); no honest
party output; `terminated` was unreachable.

The termination theorem (`avss_termination_AS_fair`) was still
logically sound — for such a stalling adversary, the user-supplied
`h_U_mono` / `h_U_strict` certificate witnesses *could not be
discharged*, so the theorem held vacuously for that input.  But the
theorem carried no operational content in that case.  A naive reader
might have inferred "the formalised model implies an honest dealer's
protocol always terminates"; the precise statement was "the protocol
terminates *if the adversary eventually fires `dealerShare` and the
fair-progress certificate is dischargeable*".

In CR '93 an honest dealer broadcasts by definition (the dealer's
share-out step is part of the protocol script, not the adversary's
schedule).

#### Phase B fix landed

✅ **Resolved (pre-Phase-8 historical fix).** Phase B folded
`dealerShare` into `avssFairActions` (Option B2 from the original
plan).  Phase 8.5d-α subsequently replaced `dealerShare` with the
per-party `dealerShareTo`, retaining the same fairness assumption
for `(honest dealer ∧ honest p)` pairs (see §11.4).  The new
strict-decrease witness `avssU_step_dealerShare_lt` requires
`(honestSet s).card ≥ 1`; the helper
`honestSet_pos_of_not_terminated_pre_share` derives this from
`¬ terminated s ∧ avssTermInv s ∧ s.dealerSent = false`.  When
`honestSet.card = 0`, every honest-party conjunct of `terminated`
is vacuous and the queue conjuncts follow from inv clause 1, so
`terminated s` already holds — the strict-decrease witness is only
needed off-terminated, exactly the context of `avssCert.U_dec_det`.

`avssU_step_lt_of_fair` was extended with a `(hnt : ¬ terminated s)`
premise to thread the helper into the dealerShare case; the three
call sites in `avssCert` (`V_super_fair`, `U_dec_det`,
`U_dec_prob`) all already had the `_hnt` parameter unused, so the
threading was mechanical.

For corrupt-dealer scenarios, folding `dealerShare` into the fair
set is conservative: under fair scheduling, even a corrupt dealer
is forced to broadcast.  Real-CR allows a corrupt dealer to refuse
to broadcast, in which case CR's termination is conditional on the
dealer's behaviour.  A future Phase 8 with per-party dealer
messages would distinguish honest- vs. corrupt-dealer fairness
more precisely.

**Bridge to literature.**  Two clean fixes were considered:

  1. **Phase B (small):** add the hypothesis "honest dealer ⇒
     `dealerShare` eventually fires" at the call site of
     `avss_termination_AS_fair` (a stutter-free trace condition or a
     fairness side-condition outside `avssFair`).
  2. **Phase B alt:** fold `dealerShare` into `avssFairActions` (so
     fair scheduling guarantees it fires).  Slightly tighter: the
     resulting `avssFair` then enforces "dealer eventually shares"
     for every adversary, so honest-dealer termination is genuinely
     unconditional.

Either fix is local; neither requires changes to the cryptographic
content.  Phase A's docs commit flagged the issue; this PR's
Phase B commit chose Option B2 (fold `dealerShare` into
`avssFairActions`).

### 11.4. C4 — Selective non-broadcast and the load-bearing role of Bracha amplification

✅ **Resolved by the Phase 8.5d chain** (PRs #68 / #69 / #70).  The
per-party `dealerShareTo` action surgery (Phase 8.5d-α, PR #68) plus
`s.coeffs` migration to μ₀ (Phase 8.5d-β, PR #69) plus termination
re-scoping to take `h_consistent_quorum` (Phase 8.5d-γ, PR #70)
jointly formalise CR's conditional-termination semantics.  See
`AVSS.consistent_quorum_AE` for the runtime hypothesis form, and
`AVSS.consistent_quorum_AE_of_all_honest_delivered` for a sanity
check confirming honest-dealer schedules satisfy it trivially.

**Resolution status (citation).**

| PR | Role |
|---|---|
| **#68** (8.5d-α) | `dealerShare` → `dealerShareTo (p : Fin n)`; `s.dealerSent : Fin n → Bool`; per-party `actionGate`/`avssStep`/variant updates. |
| **#69** (8.5d-β) | `s.coeffs` removed from `AVSSState`; `coeffs` parameter threaded through `initPred`, `avssSpec`, `avssCert`, all theorem statements; `dealerCommit : Fin n → DealerPayload t F` field carries per-party commitments. |
| **#70** (8.5d-γ) | Termination re-scoped: `avss_termination_AS_fair` (and `_traj`/`_rushing`) take `h_consistent_quorum : consistent_quorum_AE sec corr coeffs μ₀ A`; sanity-check `consistent_quorum_AE_of_all_honest_delivered`. |

**New theorem statement (post-Phase-8.5d-γ).**

```lean
theorem avss_termination_AS_fair
    (sec : F) (corr : Finset (Fin n)) (h_corr : corr.card ≤ t)
    (coeffs : Fin (t+1) → Fin (t+1) → F)
    (A : Adversary _ _) (h_fair : avssFair A)
    (h_consistent_quorum :
      consistent_quorum_AE sec corr coeffs avssInitMeasure A)
    (h_drop_io : ...) :
    AlmostDiamond
      (traceDist (avssSpec sec corr coeffs) A avssInitMeasure)
      terminated
```

The `consistent_quorum_AE` hypothesis encodes CR '93's structural
runtime requirement (≥ n − t honest parties have both
`dealerSent p = true` and `dealerMessages p ≠ none` along the
trace, AE-eventually) — the conditional-CR statement that was
previously bypassed by Phase B's unconditional-fairness route.

⚠ **Closely related to §2 (Dealer-to-party communication) but worth
spelling out separately**: in CR '93, a corrupt dealer's adversarial
power includes choosing *which subset of parties* to send shares to,
not just whether to broadcast at all.

#### What CR '93 actually models

The CR adversary controlling the dealer can:

  1. Refuse to broadcast entirely (handled by C3's fix in our model
     by forcing `dealerShare` via fairness).
  2. **Send shares to only some honest parties** (selective non-
     broadcast — what we call C4).
  3. Send *inconsistent* shares to different parties (handled by §2's
     deferred per-party messages).

For (2), CR distinguishes two regimes:

  * **At least `n − t` honest parties receive consistent shares**:
    Bracha amplification fires.  The honest parties who received
    shares broadcast echoes; those who didn't receive shares but
    observe `≥ n − t` echoes amplify via the `readyReceived ≥ t + 1`
    rule (`partyAmplify` in our model).  All honest parties output
    values jointly consistent with some bivariate polynomial.
  * **Fewer than `n − t` honest parties receive shares**: no echo
    cascade, no amplification, no termination.  The protocol simply
    doesn't decide.  CR's termination theorem is conditional on the
    first regime.

The protocol **is correct in both regimes** — there are no
incorrect outputs in the no-termination case (output is `none`,
not "wrong"), and in the termination case Bracha amplification's
joint-consistency property holds.  What's *not* unconditional is
termination.

#### What our model captures and what it doesn't

`dealerShare`'s effect (post-Phase-B) at `AVSS.lean:319–323`
populates `s.inflightDeliveries` with **all** honest parties:

```
| .dealerShare =>
    { s with
      dealerSent := true
      inflightDeliveries :=
        (Finset.univ : Finset (Fin n)).filter (fun p => p ∉ s.corrupted) }
```

So in our model every honest party always receives a share, and
selective non-broadcast is impossible — the adversary cannot choose
which parties to short.  Consequence:

  * The `partyAmplify` action exists in the state machine and the
    variant analysis treats it as fair-required, but in practice
    every honest party can take the direct path
    `partyDeliver → partyEchoSend → partyReady → partyOutput`
    since they all receive shares.  `partyAmplify` is never
    operationally load-bearing in our reachable traces.
  * Bracha amplification's role — letting parties *without* a direct
    share output via echo cascade — is not exercised.
  * Termination becomes unconditional under fair scheduling
    (post-Phase-B), where in CR it would be conditional on the
    `≥ n − t` consistent-share regime.

#### Implication for the formalised theorems

  * **Termination**: stronger than CR — our model forces the dealer
    to broadcast to all honest parties, so the "fewer than `n − t`"
    regime is unreachable.  CR's conditional termination is bypassed
    rather than proved.
  * **Correctness/commitment**: weaker threat model — selective
    non-broadcast and inconsistent-broadcast attacks are not
    considered.
  * **Secrecy**: orthogonal — selective non-broadcast doesn't change
    what corrupt parties learn about `sec`, only whether honest
    parties terminate.  The secrecy theorems remain meaningful.

#### Phase 8 closes C4

The per-party dealer messages refactor (Phase 8, scoped separately)
addresses C4 directly:

  * `dealerMessages : Fin n → Option DealerPayload` — the dealer's
    output to each party, possibly `none` (corrupt dealer chose to
    skip this party) or `some payload`.
  * `partyDeliver p` reads from `dealerMessages p` rather than a
    global `coeffs`.
  * Honest parties without a direct share rely on `partyAmplify`.
  * Termination becomes conditional on "≥ `n − t` honest parties got
    consistent shares" — the genuine CR statement.

Phase 8 also addresses §2 (per-party messages), C1 (corrupt-party
sends), and C2 (honest broadcasts to corrupt receivers) — all four
gaps are entangled and a single refactor closes them together.

**Phase 8.5 subdivision (2026-05-05).**  C4 closure (`dealerShareTo`
+ `coeffs` migration + termination re-scope) is **PR 8.5d**.
Sequenced last because it depends on the gate surgery (8.5b) and
secrecy chain re-proof (8.5c) being in place.  Crucially, 8.5d also
migrates `s.coeffs` out of state into `μ₀` (the witness sample);
this completes the migration-stability story from PRs #43, #45, #48,
#49 (existential-witness theorem forms) by retiring the
state-level `s.coeffs` field entirely.

##### Phase 8.1 (this PR) — A-lite refactor: data carrier in place

Phase 8.1 introduces the `DealerPayload` structure and the
`dealerMessages : Fin n → Option (DealerPayload t F)` field on
`AVSSState` without changing any theorem semantics.  The `s.coeffs`
field is retained as the dealer's *intended* polynomial; `dealerShare`
populates `dealerMessages` deterministically from `s.coeffs` and
`s.partyPoint` for every party (honest and corrupt).  The per-party
`partyDeliver` and `partyCorruptDeliver` actions are migrated to read
from `dealerMessages` (with a new `(dealerMessages p).isSome` gate)
rather than recomputing `rowPolyOfDealer` directly.

The refactor is supported by a new sibling invariant
`dealerMessagesInv s` ensuring every populated `dealerMessages p`
agrees with `rowPolyOfDealer s.partyPoint s.coeffs p` on its `rowPoly`
field.  `colPoly` is currently a `0` placeholder; PR 8.4 will start
populating it for cross-check verification.  All existing classical
theorems re-prove unchanged, lifting the joint
`outputDeterminedInv ∧ dealerMessagesInv` (or `honestDealerInv ∧
dealerMessagesInv`) and projecting back to the surface invariant.

What Phase 8.1 sets up for later PRs:

  * **PR 8.4** (corrupt-party sends, payload-carrying echoes): drop
    the `p ∉ s.corrupted` gates from `partyEchoSend` / `partyReady` /
    `partyAmplify`; carry payload values via the echo actions.
  * **PR 8.5** (selective non-broadcast): let `dealerShare` populate
    only a subset of parties; let a corrupt dealer choose
    `dealerMessages p` independently of `s.coeffs`.
  * **PR 8.6** (full secrecy): re-prove operational secrecy in the
    row+column form.

What Phase 8.1 does *not* do:

  * Move `s.coeffs` out of state into `μ₀` (PR 8.5).
  * Drop the `p ∉ s.corrupted` honest-action gates (PR 8.4).
  * Allow corrupt-dealer freedom in `dealerMessages` (PR 8.5).

### 11.5. C5 — Deterministic-adversary quantification only

✅ **Resolved by Phase 9** (PRs #41, #46, #47, #49, #53, #54, #55,
and the integration PR — see §13.1).  Each AVSS classical theorem
now has a randomised analog quantified over `RandomisedAdversary`
(PR #41) or the literature-standard `AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary`
(PR #55); together they cover correctness, commitment, secrecy
(step-`k` full form via 9.6/PR #53; coord-0 grid form via 9.3/PR #47;
step-`k` rushing wrapper `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_randomised`
via the integration PR), and termination (via 9.4/PR #54 and the
rushing wrapper in PR #55).  The original deterministic theorems
remain as the structural backbone — the randomised analogs route
through the Phase 9.2 lifting meta-theorems
(`AlmostBoxRandomised_of_inductive`,
`randomisedTraceDist_map_eq_of_deterministic_at_zero`) plus the
randomised `FairASTCertificate.sound` core, and the rushing
wrappers are one-liners through `R.toRandomisedAdversary`.

**⚠ Cross-branch reconciliation caveat (post-Phase-8.5d).**  Phase
9's `avss_termination_AS_fair_randomised` (PR #54) and
`_rushing_randomised` (PR #55) are typed against the **pre-Phase-8.5b
deterministic-descent route** (via `RandomisedFairASTCertificate.sound`,
which requires `RandomisedTrajectoryUMono` — AE-monotone `U` along
the randomised mixture trace).  Two issues compound under the
post-Phase-8.5b/d AVSS model:

1. **Soundness route mismatch.** The deterministic version
   `avss_termination_AS_fair` switched in Phase 8.5d-γ from the
   deterministic-descent route to the BC running-min route
   (`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_bc_of_running_min_drops`), taking
   `consistent_quorum_AE` and `TrajectoryFairRunningMinDropIO`
   hypotheses.  The randomised analogs still call the
   deterministic-descent route under the hood.

2. **`RandomisedTrajectoryUMono` is unsatisfiable for AVSS.**  The
   reason for the deterministic switch — corrupt-fired actions
   bump `avssU` post-Phase-8.5b — applies equally at the randomised
   level.  AE-monotonicity is false under any `RandomisedAdversary`
   that schedules corrupt-fired sends.  So the existing
   `avss_termination_AS_fair_randomised` is **vacuously callable
   but not usefully callable** for any post-Phase-8.5b AVSS
   instance: the `RandomisedTrajectoryUMono` hypothesis cannot be
   discharged.

This is **not a small mechanical thread-through fix.**  Closing
the gap requires:

  * **Framework PR** — add
    `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_bc_of_running_min_drops_randomised`
    in `Leslie/Prob/Liveness.lean` plus
    `RandomisedTrajectoryFairRunningMinDropIO` in
    `Leslie/Prob/RandomisedAdversary.lean`.  Real measure-theoretic
    work (~150–200 LOC) — the BC running-min argument needs to be
    re-derived for the kernel-mixture trace, paralleling the
    deterministic version's structure.

  * **AVSS-side PR** — define
    `consistent_quorum_AE_randomised` (analog of `consistent_quorum_AE`
    on the randomised mixture trace), switch
    `avss_termination_AS_fair_randomised` and `_rushing_randomised`
    to call the new framework theorem, drop the now-unsatisfiable
    `RandomisedTrajectoryUMono` hypothesis.  ~80 LOC.

Total: ~230–280 LOC across 2 stacked PRs.  Tracked as a Phase
11-β-followup or a new Phase 12-prerequisite (depending on whether
the framework lift is composed before or after Phase 11-β
extracts `Secrecy.lift_to_randomised`).

The other Phase 9 randomised forms — `avss_correctness_AS_*` /
`avss_commitment_AS_*` / `avss_secrecy_AS_*` (PRs #47, #49, #53,
#55, #56, #74) — are aligned with their deterministic counterparts
and do not need rebase work; only termination is affected.

The historical context below is retained for completeness; readers
of new code should reach for the `_randomised` and
`_rushing_randomised` variants.

⚠ Historical: **All theorems in this formalisation universally quantify over
*deterministic* adversaries** — both the legacy `Adversary σ ι` and
the rushing `RushingAdversary σ ι V` are pure functions
(`History → Option Action` and `view-history → Option Action`
respectively) rather than measurable kernels.  Nothing in the
current artefact says "AVSS is secure against any adversary that
flips coins."

#### Why the cryptographic content is preserved

The standard information-theoretic argument is a Fubini /
mixture argument over the adversary's random tape.  A randomised
adversary `A_rand : (History × R) → PMF (Option Action)` is
mathematically equivalent to "pick `r ∈ R` from some distribution
`ρ`, then run the deterministic adversary `A(r)` parameterised by
`r`."  By Fubini composition with the random tape:

```
traceDist[A_rand] sec  =  ∫_R  traceDist[A(r)] sec   dρ(r)
```

Each of the four headline theorem forms lifts under this mixture
by an elementary measure-theoretic argument:

| Theorem form | Lifting argument |
|---|---|
| **Secrecy** (pushforward equality `(traceDist sec).map f = (traceDist sec').map f`) | Pushforward and mixture commute: `∫ (traceDist[A(r)] sec).map f dρ = (traceDist[A_rand] sec).map f`.  Equation holds pointwise in `r`, so it holds after integration. |
| **Correctness / Commitment** (`AlmostBox`: `∀ᵐ ω ∂traceDist, P(ω)`) | If `traceDist[A(r)]{¬P} = 0` for every `r`, then `traceDist[A_rand]{¬P} = ∫ traceDist[A(r)]{¬P} dρ = 0`.  Fubini, plus `P` measurable. |
| **Termination** (`AlmostDiamond`: `∀ᵐ ω, ∃ k, terminated (ω k).1`) | Same Fubini argument as correctness; the fairness hypothesis lifts cleanly because `TrajectoryFairAdversary`'s progress witness is itself an AE statement on the trace measure. |

So mathematically the lift is automatic and AVSS genuinely is
secure against randomised adversaries.  The gap is purely
formal — the surface theorem statements name the deterministic
type.

#### Why the `simSimulate` AE-bridge specifically would break under randomised adversaries

The Phase 7.4 inductive AE-bridge
(`traceDist_AE_eq_avssSimulateTrace`) crucially assumes:

  1. Each effect is `PMF.pure` (Dirac).
  2. The schedule is a function, not a kernel.

A randomised adversary breaks (2): the kernel branch in the
trace-construction recurrence no longer collapses to a single
Dirac point, instead becoming a mixture of Diracs which is not
itself a Dirac.

The clean fix is **not** to lift the bridge to kernel form
(that's option (c) in §12.4-style risk analysis — strictly more
work and only needed if a downstream consumer wants a kernel-form
simulate).  Instead, lift the **headline** theorems via a one-shot
meta-theorem that operates above the bridge — the bridge stays in
its current deterministic form as a structural fact about
deterministic-strategy AVSS.

#### Phase 9 fix (planned — see §13)

A **single one-shot meta-theorem** in `Leslie/Prob/` covers every
property in the library uniformly: define `RandomisedAdversary` as
a measurable kernel, prove
`AlmostBox.lift_to_randomised`, the matching forms for
`Measure.map`-equality (secrecy) and `AlmostDiamond` (termination),
and every theorem in `AVSS.lean` (and any other protocol module)
immediately re-states against randomised adversaries by
composition.  No protocol-specific work; ≈150–250 LOC total.

The simulate AE-bridge stays deterministic; the lifting argument
operates above it.

### 11.6. Correctness/commitment subtlety (per-party share, not the secret)

This is not strictly an *adversary-power* restriction — it's a
restatement subtlety that affects how readers should interpret the
correctness and commitment theorems.

`avss_correctness_AS` concludes

```
v = bivEval s.coeffs (s.partyPoint p) 0
```

for every honest party `p` with output `v` — i.e., each honest party
outputs its **per-party share** `f_p(0)`, **not the secret**
`s.coeffs 0 0`.  This is consistent with CR-style AVSS where outputs
are *shares* and reconstruction is a separate phase, but readers who
expect the colloquial "honest dealer ⇒ honest outputs equal `sec`"
will be surprised: that holds only after `avss_reconstruction`'s
Lagrange step (any `t + 1` distinct honest shares interpolate at `0`
to recover `s.coeffs 0 0`).

`avss_commitment_AS` is similarly "every honest output is
`bivEval coeffs (partyPoint p) 0`" — strong enough (combined with
`avss_reconstruction`) to imply the literature's "any `t + 1` honest
outputs Lagrange-interpolate to one secret", but the model's
commitment is structurally trivial because there is only one
`s.coeffs` field in the state (already disclosed in §2).

**Bridge to literature.**  The Lagrange step is already formalised
(`avss_reconstruction`); composing it with `avss_correctness_AS`
gives the user-facing "honest dealer ⇒ recovered secret = `sec`"
property at any committee of `t + 1` honest parties.  The
*genuinely-harder* commitment property — "the corrupt dealer cannot
fool honest parties into outputting values inconsistent with any
single bivariate polynomial" — is structural in this model (one
global `s.coeffs`) and recovered properly only under Phase 8's
per-party dealer messages.

## Future directions

The honest path to a literature-faithful AVSS — what we'd call a "Phase B+"
trajectory — has four components, each shippable as a separate PR:

1. ✅ **Phase 6: Operational view secrecy in the current adversary model.**
   Replace `coalitionGrid` with `coalitionView` (corrupt parties' actual
   `local_`).  Prove `coalitionView` factors through `coalitionGrid +
   schedule + invariants`.  Result: a theorem that says the corrupt
   parties' state distribution is invariant in `sec`, *under the existing
   strong adversary, jointly with the schedule prefix*.  Caveat: still
   doesn't address adversary information leakage via scheduling
   decisions (handled by Phase 7).  **Landed in PR #33.**

2. ✅ **Phase 7.1: Define `RushingAdversary`.**  New generic adversary
   type in `Leslie/Prob/Adversary.lean` whose strategy is a function of
   the view-history (via a `ProtocolView σ V` projection).  Adapter
   `toAdversary` lifts back to plain `Adversary σ ι`.  Sanity lemma:
   `R.toAdversary.schedule h = R.schedule (R.viewHistory h)` (rfl).
   **Landed in this PR.**

3. ✅ **Phase 7.2: AVSS instantiation.**  `avssCoalitionView corr` —
   the corrupt coalition's local-state projection, packaged as a
   generic `ProtocolView`.  `AVSSRushingAdversary corr` abbreviation
   for the canonical rushing-adversary type for AVSS.  **Landed in
   this PR.**

4. ✅ **Phase 7.3: Re-prove existing classical theorems against
   `RushingAdversary`.**  `avss_termination_AS_fair_rushing`,
   `avss_correctness_AS_rushing`, `avss_commitment_AS_rushing` — thin
   wrappers around the classical theorems via `R.toAdversary`.
   `avss_reconstruction` is purely algebraic, no rushing version
   needed.  **Landed in this PR.**

5. ✅ **Phase 7.4 + 7.5: schedule-leakage-closing theorem.**  See
   §9 above — the cryptographic-core composition that produces the
   unconditional `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` (canonical name).
   Intermediate variants `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_via_aux` and
   `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_via_init_invariant` are retained
   as the conditional building blocks.  **Landed.**

6. ⏳ **Phase 8: Per-party dealer messages — full literature-faithful AVSS.**
   Closes the four entangled gaps **§2 (dealer-to-party communication),
   C1 (corrupt-party sends), C2 (honest broadcasts to corrupt
   receivers), C4 (selective non-broadcast)** in a single coherent
   refactor.  After Phase 8, AVSS matches Canetti–Rabin '93's model:
   per-party dealer messages, corrupt-party send actions, honest
   broadcasts to corrupt receivers, and selective non-broadcast as an
   adversary capability.  Termination becomes conditional on Bracha
   amplification, as in the literature.

   This is **the load-bearing remaining gap**.  Estimated 1500–2200 LOC
   across 6–8 PRs.  See **§12** below for the detailed plan and
   status tracker.

Estimated cost: Phase 6 ≈ 600 LOC (landed); Phase 7.1 ≈ 130 LOC
(landed); Phase 7.2 ≈ 90 LOC (landed); Phase 7.3 ≈ 70 LOC (landed);
Phase 7.4+7.5 ≈ 800 LOC (landed); Phase 7.7 (distribution refactor)
≈ 780 LOC (landed); Phase A (docs) ≈ 150 LOC (landed); Phase B
(C3 fix) ≈ 200 LOC (landed); Phase 8 ≈ 1500–2200 LOC (in progress).

## 12. Phase 8 — per-party dealer messages: detailed plan + status tracker

This section tracks the multi-PR Phase 8 initiative as it lands.
Each row corresponds to one PR; statuses move from ⏳ pending to 🚧

### 12.2. Sequencing — actual landed order

The actual landed sequence (PR-by-PR), which differs from the
2026-05-05 / 2026-05-06 planning subdivisions:

```
8.1 (#39) → 8.2 (#43) → 8.3 (#45) → 8.4 (#48) →
8.5a (#57) → 8.5b-framework (#59) →
8.5b-α (#60) → 8.5b-β (#61) → 8.5b-γ (#62) →
8.5b-γ-followup (#63) → 8.5b-γ-followup-2 (#64) →
8.5b-δ (#65) → 8.5c (#66) → 8.5b-ε (#67) →
8.5d-α (#68) → 8.5d-β (#69) → 8.5d-γ (#70) →
8.5d-δ (this PR)
```

**Pending after this PR.**

  * **8.6** depends on 8.5d-γ's adversary model (selective
    non-broadcast + per-party messages + `s.coeffs` in μ₀).
  * **8.7** likely no-op (model edited in place; no parallel
    form to retire).
  * **8.8** subsumed by 8.5d-δ.
  * **Phase 11** (§14) — secrecy framework abstraction; **closed
    (✅ 11-α / 11-γ / 11-δ / 11-δ-followup / 11-ε landed)**; 11-β
    (randomised lift) remains ⏸ deferred until Phase 9
    (`RandomisedAdversary`) merges — its scope is then a one-shot
    Fubini lift independent of any further AVSS work.

### 12.3. Post-Phase-8 state — **canonical reference (frozen 2026-05-07)**

After the 8.1 → 8.5d chain landed (PRs #39 / #43 / #45 / #48 / #57 –
#70), AVSS matches Canetti–Rabin '93's threat model up to row + column
secrecy (deferred to 8.6).  This table is the **canonical citation
target** for downstream work.

| Theorem | Pre-Phase-8 (historical) | **Post-Phase-8 (this state)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Termination** | Unconditional under fair scheduling | Conditional on `consistent_quorum_AE` (≥ n − t honest parties have received consistent shares, AE on traces) — `avss_termination_AS_fair` |
| **Correctness** | Honest dealer ⇒ outputs consistent with `s.coeffs` (state field) | Honest dealer ⇒ ∃ witness s.t. outputs consistent with `bivEval witness ...` — `avss_correctness_AS_existential` |
| **Commitment** | Trivially true (single global `coeffs`) | Honest-dealer-conditional existential commitment (via `joinedConsistencyInv_via_vandermonde`) — `avss_commitment_AS_existential`; full corrupt-dealer strengthening is queued in Phase 8.6 |
| **Reconstruction** | Lagrange theorem | Unchanged — `avss_reconstruction` |
| **Secrecy** | Row-poly secrecy under restricted adversary | Operational view-secrecy under rushing adversary, dealerHonest-INDEPENDENT cTV bridge — `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` (existing) **and** the bivariate row+column sibling `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_bivariate` (Phase 11-δ-followup) which additionally bundles the polynomial-level corrupt-grid sec-invariance from `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_sec_invariant`. |

**Adversary model.**

  * Corrupt parties freely fire `partyEchoSend` / `partyReady` /
    `partyAmplify` (C1 closed).
  * Honest broadcasts go to corrupt receivers (C2 closed).
  * `dealerShareTo p` is per-party; corrupt dealer can selectively
    short-share (C4 closed).
  * `s.coeffs` lives in μ₀ (initial measure), not state — the witness
    is sampled at protocol start, not stored in `AVSSState`.

**Remaining gaps (for downstream callers to be aware of).**

  * **C5** (deterministic adversary quantification): closed by Phase 9
    on a parallel branch.  Cross-branch reconciliation deferred to
    merge time (see §11.5).
  * **Row + column secrecy** (the +200 LOC polynomial step deferred
    since `SyncVSS.lean §10`): ✅ **closed** by Phase 11-δ (PR #75)
    + Phase 11-δ-followup (this PR).  See §12.1 row 8.6 and §12.4
    risk 4 for the citation-level pointers.

Freeze this table as the citation reference.  Downstream protocol
work (e.g., AVSS-using-RBC composition) should cite the Post-Phase-8
column.

### 12.4. Risks

1. ✅ **Commitment proof's cryptographic content** — resolved across
   PRs 8.3 (#45) + 8.4 (#48).  PR #45 landed the existential statement
   of `joinedConsistencyInv` with a thin `s.coeffs`-witness preservation
   proof; PR #48 replaced it with the genuine Lagrange-interpolation /
   Vandermonde-uniqueness construction (`joinedConsistencyInv_via_vandermonde`)
   using `Lagrange.eq_interpolate_of_eval_eq`.  New invariant
   `partyPointInjInv` (distinct evaluation points) added as the
   standard Shamir/Vandermonde precondition.

2. ✅ **Variant analysis re-verification** — resolved by the 8.5b chain
   (PRs #57 / #60 / #65).  PR #57 (8.5a) added the `s.dealerSent = true`
   gate strengthening to preserve pre-share quiescence under C1+C2.
   PR #60 (8.5b-α) re-proved the per-action `_lt` lemmas under the new
   gates with `(hph : p ∉ s.corrupted)` premises, added the
   `isHonestFire` predicate, and renamed the dispatcher.  PR #65
   (8.5b-δ) handled the deeper issue that corrupt-fired sends bump
   `avssU` by switching the soundness route from
   `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det` (TrajectoryUMono — false under
   C1+C2) to `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_bc_of_running_min_drops`
   (BC running-min, handles non-monotone variants by tracking the
   running minimum).

3. ✅ **`corruptLocalInv` weakening cascade** — resolved by the 8.5b
   chain (PRs #60 / #62 / #66) and finalised by 8.5d-β-followup-7.
   PR #60 weakened `corruptLocalInv` to its sustainable two-clause form.
   PR #62 (8.5b-γ) re-derived `simSyncInv` under the wider broadcast
   image.  PR #66 (8.5c) cascaded through ~6+ secrecy-chain consumers
   (`coalitionView_corrupt_factors_AE` weakening + `rcases` updates
   throughout `coalitionTraceView_eq_reconstruct_AE`,
   `simAlgebraicView`'s inductive bridge, etc.).  The final cTV bridge
   was made dealerHonest-INDEPENDENT in 8.5d-β-followup-7 via a new
   `coalitionRowPolyAlignedInv` structural alignment invariant —
   eliminating the need for the originally-planned `coalitionTrivialView`
   factoring layer.

4. ✅ **Row + column secrecy** (PR 8.6 / Phase 11-δ) — **landed
   2026-05-07, axiom-clean.**  The polynomial-level row+column
   uniformity theorem
   `Leslie.Prob.Polynomial.bivariate_evals_uniform_row_col` is landed:
   for any `R ⊆ F` with `|R| ≤ t` and `0 ∉ R`, and any subset
   `S ⊆ R ×ˢ R`, the joint evaluation distribution at `S` of the
   uniformly sampled bidegree-`(t, t)` polynomial with `f(0, 0) = sec`
   is uniform on `↑S → F` — generalising the rectangular-only
   `bivariate_evals_uniform_full` (Phase 7.7) to arbitrary subsets.
   Proof reduces to the rectangular form plus a constant-fiber
   projection along `↑S ↪ ↑R × ↑R`, captured by the auxiliary
   `PMF.uniform_pi_restrict`.  AVSS-side wrappers
   `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_uniform` (uniformity) and
   `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_sec_invariant` (sec-invariance corollary)
   are landed in §19.6.  All four declarations are
   `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`-axiom-clean (zero
   sorries; the headline cryptographic reasoning — Vandermonde+
   Lagrange in two directions — is fully captured by
   `bivariate_evals_uniform_full`'s existing proof).
   **Phase 11-δ-followup (this PR).** The row+col form is now wired
   into a *sibling* of the headline secrecy theorem,
   `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_bivariate` (`AVSS.lean` §19.7).  The
   sibling bundles two sec-invariances into a single citation:
   (a) the existing operational headline's
   `(coalitionTraceView, schedulePrefix)` marginal sec-invariance
   (Phase 8.5d), and (b) the polynomial-level
   `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_sec_invariant` (this PR's parent).  Both
   axes of secrecy are now available to downstream consumers
   (e.g. column cross-check protocols à la CR'93 §10) from a single
   theorem — without any changes to the existing
   `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` (backward-compat).
   **Out of scope:** axis-zero handling (`0 ∈ R` case, where the
   sec-axis is exposed and the conclusion is conditional on `sec`)
   is documented but **not** included; the current statement requires
   `0 ∉ R`.  A deeper joint-pushforward variant (extracting the
   dealer's polynomial through the trace's initial state to give a
   single trace-level joint sec-invariance) is also queued for a
   later phase — see §14 Phase 11-ε notes.

### 12.5. Maintenance protocol

This tracker is the source of truth for Phase 8 status.  As each PR lands:

  1. The PR's own commit message updates the corresponding row of §12.1 (statuses ⏳ → 🚧 → ✅).
  2. New caveats discovered during implementation are added to §11 (or to a new sub-section here if scope-specific).
  3. After Phase 8 completes, §11.1–§11.4 caveats should be marked "✅ resolved by Phase 8 (PR #N)" and the post-Phase-8 state table (§12.3) frozen as the citation reference.

If the plan changes in the middle (e.g., a worker discovers a structural issue that re-scopes a PR), the affected row's status reverts to 🚧 with a footnote describing the change.

### 12.6. Phase 8.6 redesign findings (post-PR #95)

**Status**: paused.  The original 4-step plan (echo type expansion → echoValid predicate → bivariateAlignedInv state invariant → drop honest-dealer guards) was attempted in two PRs and found structurally unsound at step 2.

#### What was attempted

  * **PR #88** (Worker 1, `feature/phase8-6`).  ~1086 LOC of model surgery:
    - Expanded `AVSSLocalState.echoesReceived : Finset (Fin n)` → `Finset (Fin n × F)` (sender + value).
    - Expanded `AVSSState.inflightEchoes : Finset (Fin n × Fin n)` → `Finset (Fin n × Fin n × F)`.
    - Updated `partyEchoSend` / `partyEchoReceive` action labels to carry the value.
    - Threaded preservation through all Phase-1 invariants (`avssTermInv`, `avssQueueWfInv`, `avssFreshInv`, `avssFlowInv`, `corruptLocalInv`).
    - Introduced `avssInflightEchoesValueDeterminate`.
    - Halted with 4 compile errors in §17/§19 secrecy abstractions; handed off via `STEP2-HANDOFF.md`.
  * **PR #95** (Worker 2, `feature/phase8-6-step2`).  Rebased Worker 1's branch onto post-#81/#82/#89 main.  Investigated the 4 errors and concluded the handoff plan cannot work — see `STEP2-BLOCKED.md` for the diagnosis.

#### Why the original plan is unsound

`simSyncInv` is the bivariate-Shamir secrecy pairing invariant: it pins **only corrupt-party** state across two simulating traces (different secrets `c`, `c'`).  The handoff suggested adding `local_honest_rowPoly_eq : ∀ p ∉ corr, delivered → rowPoly p s = rowPoly p s'`.

But under bivariate Shamir secrecy, *honest-party row polys legitimately differ* between the two traces — that's how the same coalition view emerges from different secrets.  Forcing them equal cascades into requiring honest dealerCommit + dealerMessages agreement, which forces `c = c'` and **trivialises the secrecy claim**.

`coalitionRowPolyAlignedInv` (Phase 8.5d-β-followup-7's invariant, the obvious candidate) is **unary** — it relates corrupt parties' row-polys to the dealer's commitments within a single state, but says nothing across two simulating states.

For errors 1–3 (`corrupt_local_state_uniqueness` consumers), the planned discharge closes the honest-dealer cases but leaves the `_AE_indep` (dealerHonest-INDEPENDENT) variant unmatched: corrupt senders' row polys aren't pinned to canonical `bivEval` under arbitrary dealer choice.

#### Redesign options (Worker 2's analysis)

Three candidate paths surfaced in `STEP2-BLOCKED.md`:

| # | Path | Approach | Estimated LOC |
|---|---|---|---|
| **X** | Reconstruction-side | Thread `schedulePrefix` through `buildCorruptLocalState` and `reconstructCoalitionTraceView`.  The schedule recovers echo values directly without needing `simSyncInv` to pin them across traces. | ~600–900 |
| **Y** | Action-label refactor | Drop `(v : F)` from `AVSSAction.partyEchoReceive`; find `v` via uniqueness in `avssStep` from the existing `inflightEchoes` set.  Sidesteps the value-tracking-in-`simSyncInv` problem entirely. | ~250–400 |
| **Z** | Skip Bracha amplification entirely | Accept honest-dealer-conditional commitment as final; drop the Phase 8.6 goal.  Update §16 audit verdict accordingly. | ~30 (docs only) |

**Combined X+Y**: ~850–1300 LOC.  Either way, Worker 3's `bivariateAlignedInv` work and Worker 4's headline-guard-drop remain unchanged.

#### Recommended

Defer commitment to a path until the cost-vs-value tradeoff is reassessed.  The current `_existential` form (post-Fix 1) is honest about what it proves.  CR '93 property parity is achieved modulo this gap and the adaptive-corruption gap (§16); both are documented and not soundness issues.

If pursued later: prefer Path X+Y combined, since they address different residual sub-problems (Y closes error 4 cheaply; X is needed for errors 1-3).  Estimated total chain: ~2386-3186 LOC across 4 PRs.

#### Empirical confirmation (PR #101 — Worker 1 of redesigned chain)

A first attempt at the redesigned chain (Worker 1 on `feature/8.6`) cherry-picked PR #88's 3 commits onto current `main` and reproduced the 4 compile errors at **identical line numbers** (9782 / 9843 / 9898 / 12346) and identical residual-goal shapes — no drift since #98 merged.  Worker 1 then enumerated which errors close via Path X vs Path Y:

| Error | Site | Path that closes it |
|---|---|---|
| 1, 2, 3 | `corrupt_local_state_uniqueness` consumers | **Path X** (reconstruction-side) — confirms `WORKER_TASK.md`'s scoping |
| 4 | `simSyncInv.inflightEchoes_eq` preservation under `partyEchoSend q` | **Path Y** (action-label refactor) — *NOT* closable via Path X |

Error 4's structural shape: honest `q`'s rowPoly legitimately differs across simulating traces (different secrets `c, c'`); pinning it would force `c = c'` and trivialise secrecy.  This is the same structural unsoundness the original §12.6 plan documented for `simSyncInv` strengthening, manifesting at the echo-flight layer instead of the echo-receipt layer.

**Implication for the chain**: Step 1 must combine Path X+Y in a single PR.  Splitting into "Step 1 = Path X only" (as my initial scoping suggested) leaves error 4 unresolved.  Worker 1 stopped at the rebase-clean baseline rather than ship a partial fix; full diagnosis preserved in PR #101's `STEP1-BLOCKED.md`.  Branch `feature/8.6-with-experiment` (local) holds the cherry-pick + 4-error reproduction for forensics.

#### Empirical confirmation 2 (PR #103 — Worker 1' rebooted, combined X+Y attempt)

A second attempt with the corrected scope (combined Path X+Y in a single PR) was dispatched.  The worker delivered two unexpected discoveries:

**Discovery 1: Path X is ~20× cheaper than estimated.**  The original §12.6 estimate of "Path X 600–900 LOC" turned out to be ~30 LOC via a "Path X-lite" approach: extend `TrivialView` to carry full `Finset (Fin n × F)` (instead of projecting via `.image Prod.fst`), drop the projection in `coalitionTrivialView` / `simTrivialView`, and strengthen `corrupt_local_state_uniqueness` to full state equality.  Errors 1–3 closed cleanly.

**Discovery 2: Path Y hits a deeper structural blocker than §12.6 anticipated.**  Empirical attempt at Path Y was implemented and reverted after the worker surfaced a new issue:

> Under the C1+C2 model, corrupt receivers can fire `partyEchoReceive` with honest senders, causing receiver-state value divergence across traces.

This is the same structural-unsoundness pattern §12.6 already documented — manifesting one layer deeper.  The C1+C2 closures (Phase 8.5b) allow corrupt parties to fire actions independently of honest dealer prerequisites.  Under value-bearing echoes, a corrupt receiver receiving an honest-sender echo carries `bivEval rowPoly (partyPoint q) 0`, a value that legitimately differs across simulating traces.  This violates `simSyncInv.local_corrupt_eq` (which says corrupt-party state agrees pointwise across traces).

Path Y's revised cost estimate after this empirical attempt: **~700–1100 LOC**, not the §12.6 figure of 250–400.

#### Final disposition (post-PR #103) — **Phase 8.6 deferred indefinitely**

After three attempts (PR #88, PR #95, PR #103), each surfacing a deeper structural blocker, we declare Phase 8.6 **deferred indefinitely**.

The accumulated evidence:

| Attempt | Surfaced blocker |
|---|---|
| PR #88 (Worker 1) | 4 compile errors at echo-value reconstruction in §17/§19 secrecy abstractions |
| PR #95 (Worker 2) | The proposed `simSyncInv.local_honest_rowPoly_eq` strengthening would force `c = c'` and trivialise secrecy |
| PR #103 (Worker 1' rebooted) | Path Y attempt revealed corrupt-receiver / honest-sender interaction violates `simSyncInv.local_corrupt_eq` under C1+C2 |

The pattern: the C1+C2 closures (Phase 8.5b — corrupt-fire freedom on send-class actions) interact non-trivially with value-bearing echoes (Phase 8.6's required model surgery).  Each fix relocates the unsoundness one layer deeper.

Closing this would require either:

  * **Reverting C1+C2** — restores caveats C1 and C2 (corrupt-party send actions blocked under non-trivial dealer state); unacceptable since those closures were a literature-faithfulness improvement.

  * **A fundamentally different proof architecture** — UC-style simulation with explicit ideal functionalities, where the bivariate-Shamir secrecy is consumed as a black-box property of the ideal functionality rather than threaded through the protocol's state simulation.  This is essentially Phase 12's territory and would replace, not extend, the current secrecy proof.

We accept the honest-dealer-conditional commitment (post-Fix 1 `_existential` form) as the formalisation's bound on commitment.  This is honestly stated in the theorem name and docstring.

#### Implications for §16 audit

§16-β ("Bracha 'any-or-all' amplification → discharge `consistent_quorum_AE`") shares structural machinery with Phase 8.6 (both rely on threshold counting at the echo+ready level).  However, §16-β's goal is different — it's about discharging `consistent_quorum_AE` from `avssFair` + broadcast atomicity, not about pinning honest outputs to a single bivariate.  The C1+C2-vs-value-bearing-echoes interaction does NOT block §16-β if §16-β doesn't introduce value-bearing echoes (i.e., it could potentially be done without echo type expansion).

Whether §16-β is independently achievable is a separate question — see §16.6's recommendation table for current status (still queued, not attempted).

#### Status of artefacts (final)

  * **PR #88**: open, broken (4 errors), CONFLICTING with main.  **Close as superseded** — preserved here as a historical record of the first attempt (1086 LOC of model surgery analysis).
  * **PR #95**: open, contains Worker 2's structural-blocker analysis (`STEP2-BLOCKED.md`).  **Close as superseded** — preserved here as the canonical record of why `simSyncInv` strengthening fails.
  * **PR #101**: closed as superseded by PR #102 (which folded the analysis into this §12.6).
  * **PR #103**: open, broken build, contains Path X-lite + Path Y attempt + `STEP1-NEW-BLOCKER.md`.  **Close as superseded** — but Path X-lite (~30 LOC of `TrivialView` extension) is a useful proof-engineering improvement that could be salvaged in a separate small PR if desired.
  * **Branches**: `feature/phase8-6`, `feature/phase8-6-step2`, `feature/8.6`, `feature/8.6-blocked`, `feature/8.6-with-experiment`, `feature/8.6-step1-combined` retained for forensics.  Safe to delete after Phase 8.6 is finalised as deferred.

## 13. Phase 9 — Randomised adversary support (independent of Phase 8)

Closes caveat **C5** (deterministic-adversary quantification only,
§11.5).  This phase is **independent of Phase 8** — it can land in
parallel, since the Phase 8 refactor work happens at the
protocol-state level while Phase 9 happens at the
adversary-type level.  Either can be done first.

| **9.1** | `RandomisedAdversary` type + mixture trace measure | Define `RandomisedAdversary σ ι` as `History → PMF (Option ι)` in `Leslie/Prob/RandomisedAdversary.lean` (new file).  Define the mixture trace measure `randomisedTraceDist` via the same `Kernel.trajMeasure` plumbing as `traceDist` but with the per-step kernel sampling the strategy's PMF.  Adapter `Adversary.toRandomised : Adversary σ ι → RandomisedAdversary σ ι` lifts deterministic strategies (Dirac PMF on `Option ι`).  Sanity theorem `randomisedTraceDist_toRandomised` shows the lift agrees with `traceDist`.  Plus `@[simp]` lemmas `toRandomised_strategy` / `toRandomised_corrupt`. | ~230 | ✅ landed (PR #41) |
| **9.2** | Three lifting meta-theorems | `AlmostBoxRandomised_of_inductive` / `AlmostBox.lift_to_randomised`: per-step inductive preservation lifts to randomised AS-Box.  `randomisedTraceDist_map_eq_of_deterministic_at_zero`: secrecy form for coord-0 projections (the AVSS use case).  `AlmostDiamond.lift_to_randomised`: AS-Diamond from inductive data.  Heart of the proofs is the per-step kernel mixture identity `randomisedStepKernel_apply_tsum`.  Inductive-form hypothesis selected over the abstract Fubini-tape form (worker-task §1) since the latter would require Mathlib infrastructure on infinite product measures over countable index sets — see comments in `RandomisedAdversary.lean`'s Phase 9.2 header. | ~310 | ✅ landed (PR #46) |
| **9.3** | AVSS-side restatements (partial coverage) | `avss_correctness_AS_randomised` and `avss_commitment_AS_randomised` via `AlmostBoxRandomised_of_inductive` (re-feeding the same per-step preservation data used by the deterministic versions); `avss_secrecy_AS_step_zero_grid_randomised` via `randomisedTraceDist_map_eq_of_deterministic_at_zero` (coord-0 form). `avss_termination_AS_fair_randomised` is **NOT** lifted in this PR because PR #46's `AlmostDiamond.lift_to_randomised` is degenerate (`exact ⟨0, hω 0⟩` only); termination is deferred to Phase 9.4. Closes C5 for correctness, commitment, and coord-0 secrecy. | ~150 | ✅ landed (PR #47) |
| **9.3-existential** | Existential-witness `_randomised` analogs | `avss_correctness_AS_existential_randomised` (joint inv: `honestDealerInv` ∧ static `coeffs 0 0 = secret`) and `avss_commitment_AS_existential_randomised` (with `honestOutputCount`-precondition gate, witness from `s.coeffs`). Migration-stable: when a future PR moves `s.coeffs` out of state into `μ₀`, the existential-witness forms continue to hold (witness sourced from initial-state sample); the `s.coeffs`-direct forms from PR #47 will become stale. Closes the literature-faithful `_randomised` gap that PR #47 missed. | ~50 | ✅ landed (PR #49) |
| **9.4** | Termination lifting | Randomised analog of `avss_termination_AS_fair`: introduce `RandomisedTrajectoryFairAdversary`, refactor `Liveness.lean`'s `FairASTCertificate.sound` to share its supermartingale + finite-descent core between deterministic and randomised, expose `RandomisedFairASTCertificate.sound` and `avss_termination_AS_fair_randomised`. The shared core takes the form of three measure-generic `_on` theorems (`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det_on`, `pi_infty_zero_fair_on`, `partition_almostDiamond_fair_on`) that take an arbitrary trace measure plus an AE-trajectory invariant lift; deterministic and randomised specialise via `AlmostBox_of_inductive` and `AlmostBoxRandomised_of_inductive` respectively. Path **(c)** of §13.4 (specialised: generic over the trace measure rather than over the effect kernel — equivalent in content, simpler to implement). The `_rushing_randomised` wrapper is deferred to Phase 9.5 (which introduces `AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary`). | ~280 | ✅ landed (PR #TBD) |
| **9.5** | Rushing-randomised adversary + 4 rushing wrappers | `AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary` — randomised analog of `AVSSRushingAdversary` with PMF-valued schedule on the rushing-view σ-algebra (via `instCountableAVSSRushingView`); `R.toRandomisedAdversary` adapter; plus thin `_rushing_randomised` wrappers for correctness (existential-witness form), commitment (corrupt-dealer existential-witness form), coord-0 grid secrecy, and termination (the last depends on 9.4). Adds the measurability infrastructure on the rushing view that 9.3 deferred. See §13.5 for the full plan. | ~140 | ✅ landed (PR #55) |
| **9.6** | Step-`k` general secrecy | `avss_secrecy_AS_randomised` at coord `k > 0` — generalise PR #47's coord-0 form using `avssStep_coalitionGrid_invariant` lifted branchwise across `randomisedStepKernel`. The schedule PMF integrates the AE-equality. Independent of 9.4 / 9.5. See §13.6 for the full plan. | ~50 | ✅ landed (PR #53) |
| **9-integration** | Step-`k` rushing-randomised secrecy + Phase 9 stack merge | Merges PRs #53 (9.6) and #55 (9.5) into PR #54's stack. Exposes the literature-faithful `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_randomised` (step-`k` rushing-randomised secrecy form) — a one-line wrapper around PR #53's `avss_secrecy_AS_randomised` via `R.toRandomisedAdversary`. Resolves the docs-conflict on §13 closure notes between the 9.4-followup and 9.5 stacks. Updates §11.5 C5 closure citation to its final form. | ~30 (incl. merge) | ✅ landed (PR #TBD) |

### 13.2. Sequencing

  * **PR 9.1** depends on nothing else — can be dispatched immediately.
  * **PR 9.2** depends on 9.1 (needs the type + mixture trace measure).
  * **PR 9.3** depends on 9.2 (needs the lifting meta-theorems to compose).
  * **PR 9.3-existential** depends on 9.3 (re-uses the lift pattern
    and per-step preservation lemmas from PR #47); ships the
    literature-faithful existential-witness analogs missing from PR #47.
  * **PR 9.4** depends on 9.3-existential (needs the partial-coverage
    AVSS lifts in place so the termination machinery slots into the
    same restatement pattern); independent of 9.5 and 9.6.
  * **PR 9.5** depends on 9.3-existential (needs the four classical
    `_randomised` analogs to wrap); the termination wrapper additionally
    depends on 9.4.  Independent of 9.6.
  * **PR 9.6** depends on 9.3 alone (the coord-0 form's
    `randomisedTraceDist_map_eq_of_deterministic_at_zero` extends
    branchwise to coord-`k` via `avssStep_coalitionGrid_invariant`).
    Independent of 9.4 and 9.5.

Phase 9 is **independent of Phase 8**: PRs 9.1–9.6 can ship in
parallel with Phases 8.1–8.8.  Once both phases land, AVSS will
quantify over arbitrary randomised rushing adversaries — the
literature-standard threat model.

### 13.3. Why this approach (Option 1) over kernel-form simulate (Option 3)

The Phase 7.4 AE-bridge `traceDist_AE_eq_avssSimulateTrace` assumes
deterministic schedules.  Two ways to lift it to randomised:

  * **Option 1 (Phase 9, this plan)**: keep the bridge deterministic;
    lift the *headline* theorems via the one-shot meta-theorem.  The
    bridge becomes a structural fact about deterministic-strategy
    AVSS, and the lifting argument operates above it.
  * **Option 3 (deferred)**: lift the bridge itself to kernel form,
    re-prove the inductive AE-bridge with a kernel-valued simulate
    `avssSimulateKernel : RandomisedRushingAdversary → ... → PMF (...)`.
    Strictly more work and only needed if a downstream consumer wants
    a kernel-form simulate.

Option 1 is the right choice because:

  1. **Amortises across the library**: every theorem in the library
     that universally quantifies over `Adversary` or
     `RushingAdversary` immediately becomes a randomised-adversary
     theorem, not just AVSS.
  2. **Smaller**: ~250 LOC total vs. ~400+ for option 3 (which would
     need to re-do every Phase 7.4–7.5 inductive proof in kernel form).
  3. **The cryptographic content lives in the deterministic case**:
     the Fubini argument is structural, not protocol-specific, so
     once the meta-theorem lands the cryptographic story is automatic.

✅ **Validated by Phase 9.5 (PR #55).**  The literature-standard
threat model — *randomised rushing* — is captured by
`AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary` and the four
`_rushing_randomised` wrappers; each is a one-liner through
`R.toRandomisedAdversary`, confirming Option 1's amortisation
claim above (no protocol-specific work, the lifting argument lives
entirely above the deterministic bridge).

### 13.4. Phase 9.4 — Termination lifting

PR #46's `AlmostDiamond.lift_to_randomised` only derives "eventually"
from "always" trivially (`exact ⟨0, hω 0⟩`).  It cannot lift true
diamond claims like `avss_termination_AS_fair`, whose proof goes
through `FairASTCertificate.sound` (supermartingale +
Borel-Cantelli on a strictly-decreasing rank function under
trajectory fairness).  Phase 9.3 (PR #47) therefore deferred the
termination restatement; PR 9.3-existential (PR #49) closed the
literature-faithful existential-witness gap for the AS-Box theorems
but did not address termination.  Phase 9.4 closes that gap.

Like the existential `_randomised` analogs in PR #49, Phase 9.4
targets the **existential-witness form** of termination (quorum-of-
honest-outputs phrased as `honestOutputCount ≥ t + 1` rather than
`s.coeffs`-direct), keeping it migration-stable across the future
`s.coeffs → μ₀` transition.

#### Liveness.lean policy for 9.4

**`Leslie/Prob/Liveness.lean` is on-limits for this PR.**  The
deterministic `FairASTCertificate.sound` and the randomised
`RandomisedFairASTCertificate.sound` share the same supermartingale +
finite-descent core.  Three implementation paths were considered:

| Path | Work | Cleanliness |
|---|---|---|
| **(a)** Modify `Liveness.lean` to parameterise the supermartingale proof | ~150 LOC, reuses deterministic core | clean abstraction |
| **(b)** Re-derive supermartingale + finite-descent locally in `RandomisedAdversary.lean` | ~250-300 LOC, full re-proof | quarantined but heavy and duplicative |
| **(c)** Generalize `FairASTCertificate.sound` to take a parameterised effect kernel | ~100 LOC in `Liveness.lean`, both versions specialise | cleanest mathematically |

**Path taken (PR #TBD): a specialisation of (c).**  Rather than
parameterise over the effect kernel, the implemented refactor
parameterises over the *trace measure*: three measure-generic
helper theorems (`pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det_on`,
`pi_infty_zero_fair_on`, `partition_almostDiamond_fair_on`) take
an arbitrary `μtrace : Measure (Trace σ ι)` plus an AE-trajectory
invariant lift (`∀ᵐ ω ∂μtrace, ∀ n, cert.Inv (ω n).1`).  The
deterministic and randomised soundness theorems both specialise
to these by supplying their respective trace measure and lifting
the invariant via `AlmostBox_of_inductive` /
`AlmostBoxRandomised_of_inductive`.  This is equivalent in content
to (c) — the spec-specific dependency factored out is precisely
the inductive `cert.Inv` lift, the only place the original proof
mentioned the effect kernel — and produces ~50 LOC less plumbing
than (c) by skipping a kernel-form intermediate.

The deterministic surface API (`FairASTCertificate.sound`'s
signature and conclusion, plus `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det`,
`pi_infty_zero_fair`, `partition_almostDiamond_fair`) is **unchanged**;
each existing theorem becomes a thin wrapper that lifts the
invariant via `AlmostBox_of_inductive` and forwards to its `_on`
counterpart.

#### Phase 9.4 introduces

  * Three measure-generic helpers in `Liveness.lean`:
    `FairASTCertificate.pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_det_on`,
    `pi_infty_zero_fair_on`, `partition_almostDiamond_fair_on`.
    The existing deterministic theorems become thin forwarding
    wrappers (surface API unchanged).
  * `RandomisedTrajectoryFairAdversary spec F μ₀` in
    `RandomisedAdversary.lean` — randomised analog of
    `TrajectoryFairAdversary` parameterised by the same fairness
    predicate, with the trajectory progress witness AE on the
    mixture trace measure.
  * `FairASTCertificate.RandomisedTrajectoryFairProgress`,
    `RandomisedTrajectoryUMono`,
    `RandomisedTrajectoryFairStrictDecrease` — analogs of the
    deterministic predicates, restated on `randomisedTraceDist`.
  * `RandomisedFairASTCertificate.sound` — randomised specialisation,
    a thin wrapper around `partition_almostDiamond_fair_on` plus
    `AlmostBoxRandomised_of_inductive`.
  * `avss_termination_AS_fair_randomised` — the AVSS-side restatement,
    a thin wrapper.

##### Note on the fairness predicate

The trajectory-form AE-progress witness used here is the same shape
as the deterministic side (`TrajectoryFairProgress`); both
deterministic and randomised soundness consume the *trajectory*
witness as input.  In the randomised setting this witness can be
derived from a structural uniform-`ε` lower bound on the schedule
PMF for gated fair actions via Borel-Cantelli ("schedule PMF assigns
total weight `≥ ε > 0` to gated fair actions infinitely often, for
some uniform `ε`"), but the soundness machinery itself does not
need that derivation: the deterministic-decrease finite-descent
route closes from the trajectory witness alone.  A constructor
lemma deriving the trajectory witness from the uniform-`ε` bound
is left as an optional follow-up (no termination soundness theorem
depends on it).

**Follow-up landed (PR #54 update):**
`RandomisedTrajectoryFairAdversary.of_uniform_epsilon_bound` in
`Leslie/Prob/RandomisedAdversary.lean` derives the trajectory
witness from the uniform-`ε` schedule-PMF lower bound on gated
fair actions.  The proof is an iterative kernel-level argument
(the analog of Borel-Cantelli II for history-conditioned Bernoulli
trials with a uniform positive lower bound):

  1. Per-step bound: at every history `h`, the kernel mass on
     "next coordinate is non-fair-firing" is at most `1 - ε`
     (from the schedule-PMF hypothesis plus a per-action
     decomposition of `randomisedStepKernel_apply_tsum`).
  2. Inductive bound: `ν({ω | ∀ k < m, ω(N+k+1).2 ∉ fairFireSet F})
     ≤ (1 - ε)^m` for all `N`, `m`, by induction on `m` using the
     `Kernel.trajMeasure` marginal recurrence
     (`map_frestrictLe_trajMeasure_compProd_eq_map_trajMeasure`).
  3. Continuity-of-measure limit: for fixed `N`, the tail event
     `{ω | ∀ n ≥ N, ω(n+1).2 ∉ fairFireSet F}` has measure
     `≤ (1-ε)^m` for every `m`, hence `0` (since `(1-ε)^m → 0`).
  4. Countable AE swap: union over `N` has measure `0`, and the
     complement gives the AE-trajectory progress witness.

This bypasses the conditional Borel-Cantelli machinery in
`MeasureTheory.Martingale.BorelCantelli`, whose connection to
`Kernel.trajMeasure` would require non-trivial infrastructure for
converting kernel mass at a history-prefix into a conditional
expectation w.r.t. the natural filtration on `Trace σ ι`.

The hypothesis is phrased on `FinPrefix σ ι n` rather than raw
`List` prefixes so that `currentState` is well-defined and the
gate predicate is meaningful.  The bound is on
`∑' i, [i ∈ F.fair_actions ∧ (spec.actions i).gate h.currentState]
R.strategy h.toList (some i)` — i.e., the schedule mass on **gated**
fair actions, since "ungated" fair-action samples stutter and do
not register as a fair firing in the trace.

The `_rushing_randomised` wrapper for termination
(`avss_termination_AS_fair_rushing_randomised`) is **closed by
Phase 9.5** (PR #55 — see §13.5), which introduces
`AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary` and the measurability
infrastructure on the rushing-view σ-algebra; the wrapper itself
is a one-liner through `R.toRandomisedAdversary` plus a
`RandomisedTrajectoryFairAdversary` bundle.

#### Files OWNED

  * `Leslie/Prob/Liveness.lean` — `FairASTCertificate.sound` refactor.
    Off-limits for **all other phases**; on-limits for 9.4.
  * `Leslie/Prob/RandomisedAdversary.lean` — `RandomisedFairASTCertificate`
    and its `.sound`.
  * `Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS.lean` — `avss_termination_AS_fair_randomised`
    wrapper.
  * `Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS-MODEL-NOTES.md` — §13.1 status row 9.4 +
    §11.5 caveat status if all of 9.4–9.6 close it.

#### Estimated LOC

~280: 100 (Liveness refactor) + 30 (`RandomisedTrajectoryFairAdversary`)
+ 120 (`RandomisedFairASTCertificate.sound` specialisation) + 30
(AVSS-side wrapper).

#### Sequencing

Depends on PR #49 (9.3-existential).  Independent of Phase 8 and
Phase 10.  Independent of 9.5 and 9.6 (they don't touch
`Liveness.lean` or fair-AST machinery).

### 13.5. Phase 9.5 — Rushing-randomised adversary + 4 rushing wrappers

✅ **Landed (PR #55).** PR 9.3 deferred the `_rushing_randomised`
wrappers because `AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary` doesn't exist yet
— defining it requires additional measurability infrastructure on
the rushing-view σ-algebra that's separate from PR 9.3's scope.
Phase 9.5 fills that gap.

#### Phase 9.5 introduces

  * `AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary` — randomised analog of
    `AVSSRushingAdversary` (the rushing-view-restricted adversary).
    Schedule is a PMF on the rushing view, with the same
    `instCountableAVSSRushingView` measurability backbone as the
    deterministic case.
  * `R.toRandomisedAdversary` adapter — projects the rushing-view PMF
    schedule to a `History → PMF (Option ι)` schedule on the full
    state.
  * Four thin `_rushing_randomised` wrappers (one-liners around the
    corresponding `_randomised` theorems from PRs #47, #49, and 9.4):
    - `avss_correctness_AS_rushing_randomised`
    - `avss_commitment_AS_existential_rushing_randomised`
    - `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_randomised`
    - `avss_termination_AS_fair_rushing_randomised` (depends on 9.4)

#### Files OWNED

  * `Leslie/Prob/Adversary.lean` (or `RandomisedAdversary.lean`) —
    `AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary` + adapter.  Existing rushing
    adversary infrastructure lives in `Adversary.lean`; the randomised
    analog should live alongside it for consistency.  This is a small
    measurability extension, not a refactor.
  * `Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS.lean` — the four wrappers.
  * `Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS-MODEL-NOTES.md` — §13.1 status row 9.5.

#### Estimated LOC

~100: 50 (`AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary` + adapter + measurability
glue) + 40 (four wrappers, ~10 LOC each).

#### Sequencing

Depends on PR #49 (9.3-existential).  The termination wrapper
additionally depends on 9.4.  Independent of 9.6.

### 13.6. Phase 9.6 — Step-`k` general secrecy

PR #47 lifted secrecy only at coord 0 (`avss_secrecy_AS_step_zero_grid_randomised`)
because PR #46's `randomisedTraceDist_map_eq_of_deterministic_at_zero`
only handles coord-0 projections.  Phase 9.6 generalises to all
`k : ℕ`.  Phase 9.5 (PR #55) added the *rushing* wrapper for the
coord-0 form (`avss_secrecy_AS_step_zero_grid_rushing_randomised`);
once 9.6 lands its step-`k` form, a parallel
`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_randomised` rushing wrapper follows
from `R.toRandomisedAdversary` by the same one-liner pattern.

#### Why this is independent of 9.4

The step-`k` lift uses the deterministic-side fact
`avssStep_coalitionGrid_invariant` (every gated action preserves
`coalitionGrid`) and integrates that AE-equality branchwise across
`randomisedStepKernel`.  No supermartingale or Borel-Cantelli
machinery is involved.  9.6 has no fair-AST machinery interaction.

#### Phase 9.6 introduces

  * `randomisedTraceDist_map_eq_of_deterministic` — step-`k`
    generalisation of PR #46's coord-0 form.  Argument: each gated
    step's effect preserves the `coalitionGrid` projection (this is
    a structural fact, not adversary-dependent), so the schedule PMF
    integration of branchwise AE-equality gives total AE-equality.
  * `avss_secrecy_AS_randomised` — the headline step-`k` form, applied
    to the AVSS-specific `coalitionGrid C D` projection.

#### Files OWNED

  * `Leslie/Prob/RandomisedAdversary.lean` — generic step-`k` lift.
  * `Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS.lean` — AVSS-specific instantiation.
  * `Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS-MODEL-NOTES.md` — §13.1 status row 9.6.

#### Estimated LOC

~50: 30 (generic step-`k` lift) + 20 (AVSS instantiation).

#### Sequencing

Depends on PR #47 only.  Independent of 9.4 and 9.5.  Can ship at
any time after PR #47.

### 13.7. Risks

  1. **Mathlib Fubini availability**: the lifting argument uses
     `MeasureTheory.Integral.Fubini` for kernel composition.  This is
     well-established mathlib infrastructure; no new measure-theoretic
     content to develop.
  2. **Measurability hypotheses**: the meta-theorem needs the
     property `P` to be measurable.  All of our existing properties
     (terminated, output-determined, coalition-view marginals) are
     measurable, but each AVSS-side restatement needs to check this.
  3. **PR 9.4 supermartingale refactor**: parameterising
     `FairASTCertificate.sound` over the effect kernel may surface
     hidden assumptions in the existing deterministic proof.  If the
     refactor proves invasive (e.g., requires API changes that ripple
     to other `Liveness.lean` callers), fall back to path (b) — local
     re-derivation in `RandomisedAdversary.lean`.  Cost: ~150 LOC
     extra.
  4. **PR 9.4 fairness predicate sharpness**: the randomised
     `TrajectoryFairProgress` analog requires a uniform `ε > 0` lower
     bound on the schedule PMF's weight on gated fair actions.
     Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Martingale.BorelCantelli` supports the
     countable-index integrated form, but the proof that the AVSS
     schedule PMF satisfies the `ε`-bound is a concrete obligation
     for AVSS callers (likely discharged via the rushing adversary's
     measurability witness).
  5. **PR 9.5 rushing-view σ-algebra**: defining
     `AVSSRushingRandomisedAdversary` requires a measurable structure
     on the rushing view that's compatible with PMF measurability.
     The deterministic case uses `instCountableAVSSRushingView`;
     the randomised case may need a `Decidable`-witnessed extension
     or a coercion to/from `Subtype` measurability.  Estimated minor.

### 13.8. Maintenance protocol

Same as §12.5 but for Phase 9: each PR's commit message updates the
corresponding row of §13.1 (statuses ⏳ → 🚧 → ✅).  After Phase 9
completes (PRs 9.1–9.6 all ✅), §11.5 (C5) should be marked
"✅ resolved by Phase 9 (PRs #41, #46, #47, #49, plus 9.4–9.6 PR
numbers)".

If 9.4 / 9.5 / 9.6 land out of order with respect to 9.4 → 9.5 (the
termination wrapper in 9.5 depends on 9.4), the affected row's
status reverts to 🚧 with a footnote describing the dependency
realisation.

### 13.9. Post-Phase-8.5d randomised termination follow-up (queued)

**Status: ⏳ pending framework PR.**

The `_randomised` and `_rushing_randomised` corollaries for
**termination** (PRs #54, #55) are typed against the
deterministic-descent route (`RandomisedFairASTCertificate.sound`).
Under the post-Phase-8.5b AVSS model, that route's
`RandomisedTrajectoryUMono` hypothesis is **unsatisfiable** because
corrupt-fired actions bump `avssU` (same reason the deterministic
version switched to BC running-min in Phase 8.5d-γ).  The randomised
termination theorems compile but are **vacuously-callable**.

To close: a two-PR stack lifting the BC running-min soundness
theorem to the randomised level.

| PR | Scope | LOC |
|---|---|---|
| **9.7-α (framework)** | `pi_n_AST_fair_with_progress_bc_of_running_min_drops_randomised` in `Leslie/Prob/Liveness.lean` + `RandomisedTrajectoryFairRunningMinDropIO` in `Leslie/Prob/RandomisedAdversary.lean`.  Real measure-theoretic content: the BC running-min argument re-derived for the kernel-mixture trace measure, paralleling the deterministic version's structure | ~150–200 |
| **9.7-β (AVSS-side)** | Define `consistent_quorum_AE_randomised` (analog of `consistent_quorum_AE` on the randomised mixture trace), switch `avss_termination_AS_fair_randomised` and `_rushing_randomised` to the new framework theorem, drop the now-unsatisfiable `RandomisedTrajectoryUMono` hypothesis, add `consistent_quorum_AE_randomised` and `RandomisedTrajectoryFairRunningMinDropIO` hypotheses | ~80 |

**Total**: ~230–280 LOC, 2 stacked PRs.

This work may be folded into Phase 11-β (which lifts `Secrecy` to
randomised at the framework level — same shape of work) or into
a Phase 12 prerequisite (UC composability requires usable
randomised termination).  Cross-reference: §11.5 cross-branch
caveat.

The other Phase 9 randomised forms — `avss_correctness_AS_*` /
`avss_commitment_AS_*` / `avss_secrecy_AS_*` (PRs #47, #49, #53,
#55, #56, #74) — are aligned with their deterministic counterparts
and do not need follow-up; only termination is affected.

### 13.10. Operational randomised secrecy follow-up (queued)

**Status: ⏳ pending Fubini plumbing.**

Phase 11-γ-randomised (PR #83) added the AVSS-side instance form
`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_randomised_instance : SecrecyRushingRandomised
... view proj`, mirroring the deterministic Phase 11-γ instance
(`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_instance`, PR #74).  The two
instances differ in **projection strength**:

| Variant | Projection wrapped | Underlying theorem |
|---|---|---|
| Deterministic (PR #74) | `(coalitionTraceView, schedulePrefix)` — operational, full literature shape | `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` (PR #43, plus 8.5d-β-followup-7 dealerHonest-INDEPENDENT chain) |
| Randomised (PR #83) | `coalitionGrid C D (ω k).1` — **algebraic grid only** | `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_randomised` (Phase 9.6, PR #53) |

The randomised instance is therefore for a **strictly weaker
projection**: it captures bivariate-grid secrecy but not the full
operational coalition-view + schedule-prefix joint distribution
that the deterministic instance proves.

To close the gap, an **operational randomised secrecy theorem**
parallel to `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` is needed.  Required
content:

  * **Randomised AE-bridge**: lift the Phase 7.4 deterministic AE-
    bridge `traceDist_AE_eq_avssSimulateTrace` (which expresses
    the rushing trace as a deterministic pushforward of μ₀) to the
    randomised mixture trace.  This requires Fubini over the
    per-step adversary PMFs.
  * **Randomised algebraic-view factoring**: lift `avssSimulateTrace`
    to a randomised analog that integrates over R's coin flips at
    each step.
  * **Headline randomised theorem**: `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_randomised_operational`,
    with conclusion `(randomisedTraceDist ...).map (coalitionTraceView, schedulePrefix) =
    same on the other secret`.

Estimated scope: ~150–250 LOC, single substantive PR, mostly in
`Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS.lean`.  May be combined with Phase 11-β-
followup (the framework-level `Secrecy → SecrecyRandomised` Fubini
direction) since both rely on similar measure-theoretic plumbing.

**Why not blocking**: the algebraic-grid randomised secrecy is
already enough for downstream Phase 12 composability arguments
that work at the polynomial level (e.g., random-secret-draw via
sum-of-uniforms).  Operational randomised secrecy is needed only
when downstream protocols want to reason about randomised
coalition-trace views directly, which is a less common pattern
in the AVSS literature.

## 14. Phase 10 — Generic deterministic-simulate meta-theorem

The Phase 7.4 inductive AE-bridge `traceDist_AE_eq_avssSimulateTrace`
currently lives in `AVSS.lean` §19.2.  Reviewing the proof: nothing
in it depends on AVSS-specific semantics.  The bridge is a fact about
**deterministic state-machine specs** (every effect is `PMF.pure`) and
**deterministic adversary strategies** — the AVSS instantiation is
the consumer, not the source of any structural reasoning.

Promoting the bridge to a meta-theorem in `Leslie/Prob/`
(a) shrinks `AVSS.lean` §19.2 to a one-page instantiation,
(b) makes the same machinery reusable by `BrachaRBC`, `SyncVSS`,
`AVSSAbstract`, and any future deterministic-spec protocol, and
(c) cleanly demarcates "protocol determinism" (structural,
generic) from "cryptographic security" (substantive, AVSS-specific).

Closely related to Phase 9 (randomised-adversary lifting): both
phases promote framework-level reasoning out of `AVSS.lean` and into
`Leslie/Prob/`.  Phase 10's meta-bridge holds for any
`(DeterministicProbActionSpec, Adversary)` pair; Phase 9's meta-lift
takes any such ∀-deterministic theorem to randomised.  Stacked
together: deterministic protocols get both for free.

### 14.1. Status tracker

| PR | Title | Scope | LOC | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **10.1** | `DeterministicProbActionSpec` + simulate machinery (data) | Define `DeterministicProbActionSpec σ ι := { init, gate, step }` in new file `Leslie/Prob/DeterministicSimulate.lean`; provide `toProbActionSpec` adapter; define generic `simulateNext` / `simulateRev` / `simulateTrace` reading only `gate`, `step`, and `Adversary.schedule`.  Plus structural `_length`, `_ne_nil`, `_succ_eq`, `_head_eq`, `_zero` simp lemmas. | ~150 | ✅ landed (PR #42) |
| **10.2** | The meta-bridge `traceDist_AE_eq_simulateTrace` | The substantive proof: for any `D : DeterministicProbActionSpec` and `A : Adversary` and any step `k`, `∀ᵐ ω ∂(traceDist D.toProbActionSpec A μ₀), ω k = simulateTrace D A (ω 0).1 k`.  Pure transcription of the existing AVSS-specific proof, with all references to `avssStep`, `avssSpec`, `actionGate` replaced by `D.step`, `D.toProbActionSpec`, `D.gate`. | ~300 | ✅ landed (PR #44) |
| **10.3** | AVSS instantiation: shrink §19.2 | Define `avssDeterministic := { gate := actionGate, step := avssStep }`. Prove `avssSpec sec corr = (avssDeterministic sec corr).toProbActionSpec` (rfl).  `avssSimulate{Next,Rev,Trace}` definitions kept verbatim (signatures unchanged); bridge lemmas `avssSimulate*_eq_simulate*` prove their propositional equality with the generic forms (the kernel's `defEq` on `noncomputable def`s with structure projections does not see through; the bridge is a small structural induction).  Replace `traceDist_AE_eq_avssSimulateTrace`'s 300-LOC inductive proof with a one-line application of `Leslie.Prob.traceDist_AE_eq_simulateTrace` plus `rw [avssDeterministic_toProbActionSpec, avssSimulateTrace_eq_simulateTrace]`.  Delete the dead helper chain (`avssSpec_R_stepKernel_AE_simulate`, `traceDist_step_zero_pair_marginal`, `traceDist_step_zero_snd_AE`, `avssSimulateRev_reverse_eq_ofFn`, old strong form). | net −185 LOC (353 deleted, 168 added) | ✅ landed (PR #51) |

**Total**: ~400 LOC across 3 PRs.  Net effect on AVSS.lean: shrinks by ~370 LOC.  Net effect on the codebase: +400 framework, -370 example = +30 LOC, but vastly more reusable.

### 14.2. Sequencing

  * **PR 10.1** depends on nothing else — can be dispatched immediately.
  * **PR 10.2** depends on 10.1 (needs the data definitions).
  * **PR 10.3** depends on 10.2 (needs the meta-theorem to apply).

Phase 10 is **independent of Phase 8 and Phase 9**: PRs 10.1–10.3 can ship in parallel with both, since:
  - Phase 8 modifies `AVSSState` and AVSS actions; Phase 10 is generic over the state/action types.
  - Phase 9 lifts deterministic theorems to randomised; Phase 10 *produces* a deterministic theorem (the AE-bridge) that 9's lifter can then handle.

When all three phases land, the AVSS chain reads:

```
(deterministic spec, det. adversary)              [Phase 10 meta-bridge]
  → trace AE-equals simulateTrace
  → (per-property pointwise reasoning, via rushing-adversary projection)
  → (deterministic theorem)                        [Phase 9 meta-lift]
  → (randomised theorem)
```

Each link is a one-shot meta-theorem; AVSS-specific content is only the
projection-and-composition step in the middle.

### 14.3. Why this is worth doing concretely

1. **Reuse**.  At least three other state-machine protocols in the library have `PMF.pure` effects:
   - `BrachaRBC` — no protocol-internal randomness; reliable broadcast.
   - `SyncVSS` — synchronous VSS, deterministic transitions.
   - `AVSSAbstract` — the simpler abstraction that predates the threshold-faithful AVSS.
   Each of these currently re-derives or hand-writes any trace-determinism reasoning it needs.  Once the meta-bridge lands, those proofs collapse to one-line instantiations.

2. **Composability with Phase 9**.  The two abstractions stack cleanly: any `(DeterministicProbActionSpec, Adversary)` pair gets the AE-bridge from Phase 10; any `∀ Adversary, P` theorem lifts to `∀ RandomisedAdversary, P` via Phase 9.  Each protocol gets both for free without further engineering.

3. **Sharper statement of what AVSS contributes cryptographically**.  Once the bridge is generic, the AVSS section is left holding only the cryptographic content: Shamir/bivariate row-poly secrecy + the polynomial-pushforward composition.  That's the right separation: protocol determinism is structural; cryptographic security is the substance.

4. **Demarcation of where randomness becomes load-bearing**.  As soon as a future protocol introduces a non-pure effect (a common-coin step, a random oracle), it stops fitting the `DeterministicProbActionSpec` abstraction — and that's the right place for the type system to register the obstruction, rather than the failure cropping up deep inside a protocol-specific lemma.

### 14.4. Subtlety — fallback parameter

The current `avssSimulateNext` takes a `fallback : AVSSState` argument used in the unreachable `prev = []` case (Lean totality).  In the meta-version this becomes `fallback : σ`.  If we want to remove it cleanly, the alternative is to define `simulateRev 0 := [(s_0, none)]` (already the base case) and take `head` as well-defined by the structural fact that the list is non-empty (`avssSimulateRev_ne_nil` already proves this).  Generalising it lets the meta-version state `simulateTrace` without a fallback.  Worth doing for cleanliness; not load-bearing.  Decide during PR 10.1.

### 14.5. Maintenance protocol

Same as §12.5 / §13.5 but for Phase 10: each PR's commit message updates the corresponding row of §14.1 (statuses ⏳ → 🚧 → ✅).  After Phase 10 completes, AVSS.lean §19.2 should be marked "✅ generalised — see `Leslie/Prob/DeterministicSimulate.lean`".

### 14.6. AVSS-side projections that stay AVSS-specific

The simulate machinery is generic; the projections downstream of it are not.  These remain in `AVSS.lean` even after Phase 10:

  * `simAlgebraicView R C k s_0 := (rowPolyOfDealer s_0.partyPoint s_0.coeffs ·, fun i p => (sim ... .local_).delivered)` — references `partyPoint`, `coeffs`, `local_.delivered`, `rowPolyOfDealer`.  AVSS-specific.
  * `simSchedulePrefix` — generic in shape, but its consumers in AVSS-side proofs reference AVSS-specific structure.
  * `coalitionTraceView`, `coalitionAlgebraicView`, `coalitionGrid` — all reference AVSS-specific types.

Phase 10 generalises the structural bridge between trace and simulate; the cryptographic projection of simulate onto the corrupt-coalition view remains AVSS-specific (and rightly so).

### 14.7. Closing note — Phase 10 complete

Phase 10 closed in PR 10.3 (#PENDING).  AVSS.lean §19.2's
`avss_traceDist_AE_eq_avssSimulateTrace` is now a one-line
instantiation of the generic meta-theorem
`Leslie.Prob.traceDist_AE_eq_simulateTrace` (PR #44) at
`avssDeterministic sec corr`.  The 300-LOC inductive proof chain in
§19.2.4 has been replaced by:

  * `avssDeterministic sec corr := { init := initPred sec corr, gate
    := actionGate, step := avssStep }` (~6 LOC).
  * Three `@[simp]` rfl-bridges
    (`avssDeterministic_{toProbActionSpec,init,gate,step}`).
  * Three structural-induction bridges
    (`avssSimulate{Next,Rev,Trace}_eq_simulate{Next,Rev,Trace}`)
    proving propositional equality with the generic forms — these
    work around a Lean kernel `defEq` quirk where structure
    projections on `noncomputable def` calls (`(avssDeterministic sec
    corr).gate`) do not unfold automatically through `rfl` in the
    presence of the surrounding `Filter.Eventually`/`Measure` machinery.
  * One-line proof of the headline theorem.

Net AVSS.lean impact: −185 LOC (353 deletions, 168 insertions).  The
`avssSimulate{Next,Rev,Trace}` definitions and structural lemmas
(`_length`, `_ne_nil`, `_succ_eq`, `_zero{,_fst,_snd}`,
`_head_eq`) are kept verbatim — they are referenced by the
downstream `avssSimulateTrace_simSyncInv` (§19.4.4) and by simp.  See
§19.2.4 in `AVSS.lean` for the new one-line proof and the deletion
manifest.

After this PR: `AVSS.lean §19.2` is marked **✅ generalised — see
`Leslie/Prob/DeterministicSimulate.lean`**.  All future protocols
that fit the deterministic-spec abstraction (BrachaRBC, SyncVSS,
AVSSAbstract) can apply the meta-theorem in one line; no further
trace-determinism plumbing needed.

## 14. Phase 11 — Secrecy framework abstraction

**Status: ✅ closed (modulo the post-Phase-9-merge deliverable 11-β).**
Phase 11-α ✅ + 11-γ ✅ + 11-δ ✅ + 11-ε ✅ landed; 11-β remains ⏸
deferred until Phase 9 (`RandomisedAdversary` integration) merges,
at which point its scope (a one-shot Fubini lift) is well-defined
and independent.

Extract `Secrecy` and `SecrecyRushing` as framework-level definitions
in `Leslie/Prob/Secrecy.lean` (Phase 11-α, ✅).  Each protocol's
headline secrecy theorem becomes an instance of the framework
abstraction (Phase 11-γ).  Phase 11-β adds the framework lift to
randomised adversaries (`Secrecy.lift_to_randomised`,
`SecrecyRushing.of_secrecy`).

**Why now (not earlier).**  Phase 8 has stabilised the AVSS-side
shape of "operational secrecy under a rushing adversary"
(`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing`'s dealerHonest-INDEPENDENT closure
via the cTV bridge).  Other protocols in the library (SyncVSS,
BenOrAsync, ...) will follow the same shape; abstracting now means
their secrecy theorems can be one-line corollaries instead of
re-deriving the chain.

**Sub-PR sequencing.**

| Sub-PR | Scope | LOC | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11-α | `Leslie/Prob/Secrecy.lean` — `Secrecy` (deterministic-adversary form) and `SecrecyRushing` (rushing form); structural lemmas (`Secrecy.mono_proj`, `SecrecyRushing.mono_proj`, `Secrecy.toRushing`) | ~140 | ✅ |
| 11-β | `Secrecy.lift_to_randomised`, `SecrecyRushing.of_secrecy` (framework lifts to randomised adversaries) | ~80 | ⏳ (deferred until Phase 9 `RandomisedAdversary` integration) |
| 11-γ | AVSS instance: `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` re-stated as `SecrecyRushing avssSpec ... := ...` | ~50 | ✅ |
| 11-δ | Apply to 8.6's row + column secrecy form (composes with the abstraction directly so 8.6 doesn't need its own framework boilerplate) | ~280 | ✅ (PR #75) — headline `Leslie.Prob.Polynomial.bivariate_evals_uniform_row_col` (statement + full proof via constant-fiber projection along `↑S ↪ ↑R × ↑R`); AVSS-side wrappers `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_uniform` / `_sec_invariant` (§19.6); auxiliary `PMF.uniform_pi_restrict`.  All axiom-clean (`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`); zero sorries. |
| 11-δ-followup | Wire the row+col form into a *sibling* of the headline secrecy theorem.  `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_bivariate` (`AVSS.lean` §19.7) bundles the existing trace-level `(coalitionTraceView, schedulePrefix)` sec-invariance and the polynomial-level `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_sec_invariant` into a single conjunction.  The original `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` is unchanged (backward-compat). | ~80 | ✅ (this PR) |
| 11-ε | Cleanup, MODEL_NOTES finalisation: §12.1 row 8.6 → ✅, §12.3 post-Phase-8 secrecy row updated to cite the new sibling, §12.4 risk 4 closed, §14 marked ✅ closed. Final axiom hygiene check on the five load-bearing AVSS theorems (`avss_termination_AS_fair`, `avss_correctness_AS_existential`, `avss_commitment_AS_existential`, `avss_reconstruction`, `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` + new sibling). | ~50 | ✅ (this PR) |

**Sequence.**  Phase 11-α landed after 8.5d-δ (this PR's parent).
Subsequent sub-PRs land before Phase 8.6, so 8.6's operational-secrecy
theorem instantiates the abstraction directly rather than re-deriving
the chain bottom-up.

**Phase 11-α deliverables (this sub-PR).**

The new file `Leslie/Prob/Secrecy.lean` adds two protocol-independent
predicates plus three structural lemmas, all axiom-clean
(`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`):

  * `Secrecy spec μ₀ proj` — operational secrecy: under any
    deterministic adversary `A : Adversary σ ι`, the projected trace
    distribution `(traceDist spec A (μ₀ sec)).map proj` is invariant
    in the secret `sec`.
  * `SecrecyRushing spec μ₀ view proj` — view-restricted variant: the
    same equality but quantified over `RushingAdversary σ ι W` whose
    `toProtocolView = view`.
  * `Secrecy.mono_proj` / `SecrecyRushing.mono_proj` — coarsening the
    projection by a measurable map preserves secrecy (via
    `Measure.map_map`).
  * `Secrecy.toRushing` — plain secrecy implies rushing-secrecy for
    any view (the universal adversary class subsumes the
    rushing-adversary image).

The two main definitions intentionally mirror the existing AVSS-side
shape so that Phase 11-γ's instantiation is a one-liner.

**Phase 11-γ deliverables (this sub-PR).**

The AVSS instance `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_instance` lives in
`Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS.lean` (§19.5) and is axiom-clean
(`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`).  Diagnosing
`avssSpec`'s `sec` parameter showed it was vestigial — `sec` only
enters `avssSpec.init`, which `traceDist` does not consume (only
`spec.actions` is read by `stepKernel`).  Rather than refactor the
~230 in-file `avssSpec sec corr coeffs` call sites, we proved the
helper lemma `traceDist_avssSpec_sec_irrelevant` (defeq via `rfl`)
and used `avssSpec 0 corr coeffs` as the canonical sec-agnostic spec
for the instance:

  * `traceDist_avssSpec_sec_irrelevant` — `traceDist` is invariant
    under the `sec` parameter; closed by `rfl` since `stepKernel`
    only references `spec.actions`.
  * `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_instance` — full
    `SecrecyRushing (avssSpec 0 corr coeffs) (μ₀ := …
    avssInitMeasure …) (avssCoalitionView corr) (proj := …)` with
    body `intro sec sec' R hR; rw [sec_irrelevant, sec_irrelevant];
    exact avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing …`.

The instance closes the AVSS deliverable for 11-γ; downstream
protocols (SyncVSS, BenOrAsync) can mirror this pattern.

(See `PHASE-8-5d-CHECKPOINT.md` for the worker-side note if a fuller
plan is recorded there.)

**Phase 11-δ deliverables (this sub-PR).**

This is the +200 LOC row+column bivariate Shamir secrecy upgrade
**deferred since SyncVSS §10**.  It generalises Phase 7.7's
`bivariate_evals_uniform_full` (rectangular `pts_x × pts_y`) to the
literature-standard form on arbitrary subsets `S ⊆ R × R`:

  * `Leslie.Prob.Polynomial.bivariate_evals_uniform_row_col` — for
    `R ⊆ F` with `|R| ≤ t` and `0 ∉ R` and any subset
    `S ⊆ R ×ˢ R`, the joint evaluation distribution at `S` of the
    uniformly-sampled bidegree-`(t, t)` polynomial with
    `f(0, 0) = sec` is uniform on `↑S → F`.  Proof: corollary of
    `bivariate_evals_uniform_full` plus a constant-fiber projection
    along `↑S ↪ ↑R × ↑R`.

  * `PMF.uniform_pi_restrict` (auxiliary) — pushforward of
    `PMF.uniform (κ → α)` along precomposition with an injection
    `proj : ι → κ` is `PMF.uniform (ι → α)`.  This is the per-coord
    constant-fiber restriction lemma; proved via
    `PMF.uniform_map_of_surjective_constFiber` plus an explicit
    bijection between the fiber `{g | g ∘ proj = h}` and
    `(κ \ image proj) → α` (size `|α|^(|κ| − |ι|)`, constant in `h`).

  * AVSS-side instantiations (`Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSS.lean` §19.6):
    `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_uniform` (uniformity of corrupt-coalition
    bivariate evaluations on any subset of `corrPts × corrPts`) and
    `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_sec_invariant` (sec-invariance corollary,
    by uniformity-on-both-sides).  Both are thin specialisations of
    the polynomial-level theorem via the standard `partyPoint`
    injection bridge.

**Axiom-cleanliness.** All four new declarations
(`bivariate_evals_uniform_row_col`, `PMF.uniform_pi_restrict`,
`avss_bivariate_corrGrid_uniform`, `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_sec_invariant`)
depend on `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` only — zero
sorries, zero custom axioms.  The existing chain through
`bivariate_shamir_secrecy_rowPoly_full` and
`avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` is unchanged.

**Out of scope for the parent (PR #75 / Phase 11-δ).** Axis-zero
handling (the `0 ∈ R` case where the sec-axis is exposed and the
conclusion becomes conditional on the sec value) is documented in
§12.4 risk 4 but not formalised; the current statement requires
`0 ∉ R`.  Wiring the row+col form into a strengthened headline was
deferred to Phase 11-δ-followup — see below.

**Phase 11-δ-followup deliverables (this PR).**

The Phase 11-δ-followup sub-PR closes part (b) of §12.1 row 8.6 — the
"wire row+col into headline secrecy" deliverable — by adding a
*sibling* theorem to `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing`:

  * `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_bivariate` (`AVSS.lean` §19.7).
    Bundles two sec-invariances into a single citation:
    **(a)** the existing trace-level
    `(coalitionTraceView, schedulePrefix)`-marginal sec-invariance
    (Phase 8.5d), and
    **(b)** the polynomial-level row+column sec-invariance from
    `avss_bivariate_corrGrid_sec_invariant` (Phase 11-δ / PR #75).
    The conjunction form is the right abstraction for downstream
    consumers because each clause matches their natural query —
    "is my operational view sec-invariant?" and "is my bivariate
    evaluation grid sec-invariant?" — and the two equalities concern
    *distinct measures* (the trace distribution vs. the
    bivariate-polynomial measure that `avssInitMeasure` is pulled
    back from).  A deeper joint pushforward that extracts the
    dealer's polynomial through the trace's initial state is
    queued for a later phase; it would add substantive measurability
    work without changing the cryptographic content.

The original `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` is unchanged
(backward-compat); the sibling is *additive*.  Axiom hygiene is
preserved on all five load-bearing AVSS theorems
(`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` only); zero sorries.

**Phase 11-ε deliverables (this PR).**

Phase 11-ε is the MODEL_NOTES finalisation that closes Phase 11.
Specifically:

  * §12.1 row 8.6 → ✅ landed (cites PR #75 for part (a) and this
    PR's `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_bivariate` for part (b)).
  * §12.3 post-Phase-8 state table's "Secrecy" row updated to cite
    the new sibling theorem alongside the existing headline.
  * §12.4 risk 4 closed — both the polynomial-level row+col upgrade
    and the headline wiring are landed.
  * §14 Phase 11 marked ✅ closed (with 11-β still ⏸ deferred for
    post-Phase-9-merge).
  * Axiom hygiene check on the five load-bearing AVSS theorems
    (`avss_termination_AS_fair`, `avss_correctness_AS_existential`,
    `avss_commitment_AS_existential`, `avss_reconstruction`,
    `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing` + new sibling
    `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_bivariate`) — all
    `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`-axiom-clean.

## How to read the formalised theorems

If you're using AVSS as a black box for downstream protocol verification:

- Use `avss_termination_AS_fair`, `avss_correctness_AS`,
  `avss_reconstruction`, and `avss_secrecy` (polynomial-level) directly.
  These have the literature-expected meaning.

- For consumers wanting the rushing-adversary (literature-standard)
  formulation of termination / correctness / commitment, use the
  `*_rushing` variants (`avss_termination_AS_fair_rushing`,
  `avss_correctness_AS_rushing`, `avss_commitment_AS_rushing`) that
  quantify over `R : AVSSRushingAdversary corr` — the
  view-restricted adversary defined in `Leslie/Prob/Adversary.lean`.

- For `avss_commitment_AS` (and `_rushing`), internalize that "in our
  model" means under the abstraction in §2 above; the theorem is a
  useful abstraction for downstream work but doesn't capture
  corrupt-dealer adversarial choice (Phase 8 territory).

- For `avss_secrecy_AS` (trace-level grid form), read as: "the
  algebraic ideal grid view distribution is invariant in `sec` along
  any trace".  Phase 6 (PR #33) extended this to the operational view
  jointly with the schedule prefix (`avss_secrecy_AS_view`), and
  Phase 6.3 added the conditional theorem
  `avss_secrecy_AS_view_conditional` whose `h_aux` hypothesis
  Phase 7.4–7.5 will discharge against `RushingAdversary` (deferred —
  see §9 above).  An *unconditional* operational secrecy theorem
  ("corrupt parties learn nothing about `sec` along any trace") is
  therefore *not yet* a single named theorem in this branch; consult
  §1, §4, §9 above.

## Citing this formalisation

When citing the formalisation in a paper or report, the precise claim is:

> Leslie's AVSS module proves the four classical Canetti–Rabin properties
> — termination, correctness, commitment, secrecy — plus reconstruction,
> all axiom-clean, against two coexisting adversary models: a legacy
> `Adversary` with read-access to the full protocol state (a strict

> projection of the state to the corrupt coalition's view.  The classical
> theorems re-prove mechanically against the rushing adversary
> (`avss_termination_AS_fair_rushing`, `avss_correctness_AS_rushing`,

## 15. Phase 12 — UC-style composability layer (queued)

Phase 11's `Secrecy` and `SecrecyRushing` abstractions are *whole-protocol*
predicates — they say nothing about how secrecy composes across
subprotocol boundaries. Many cryptographic protocols (random secret
draw, MPC, byzantine agreement with sub-rounds, ...) build on AVSS or
similar primitives as black-box subroutines. We want compositional
reasoning: "the bigger protocol inherits secrecy from the subprotocol
+ a secrecy-respecting composer", without re-opening the subprotocol's
internal proof.

This is the operational form of **Universal Composability** (Canetti
UC, Backes-Pfitzmann-Waidner reactive simulatability). The Leslie
framework needs a new abstraction layer to express it.

### 15.1. Goal

Enable reasoning of the form:

> Q is a protocol that uses P as a subprotocol (P being a
> `SubprotocolFunctionality` with secrecy on its inputs).
> Q's combiner is "secrecy-respecting" (e.g., deterministic in P's
> outputs + non-secret state, or a sum-of-uniforms form).
> Then Q inherits secrecy on those inputs.

The motivating instance: random secret draw on top of `n` AVSS
instances + a sum combiner. The honest-uniform input plus AVSS's
per-instance secrecy plus sum-of-uniforms gives Q's secrecy.

### 15.4. Key risks

1. **Conditional-independence formalisation** (12-γ): the theorem "AVSS
   instances are independent given the bigger protocol's schedule" is
   measure-theoretically subtle.  Mathlib has independence lemmas for
   product measures; we need to lift to trace distributions over
   kernel-composed protocols.  If it doesn't fit cleanly in mathlib's
   existing infrastructure, may need a substantial helper.

2. **Adversary-class subtleties**: the bigger protocol's adversary
   has joint access to all subprotocol instances' corrupt views.
   Reducing to per-instance secrecy requires care: the per-instance
   adversaries derived from a Q-adversary depend on the schedule;
   formalising this dependency is a real obligation.

3. **Subroutine vs parallel composition**: this plan covers parallel
   composition (multiple P-instances + a combiner).  Subroutine
   composition (Q invokes P, awaits output, continues) is harder —
   the Q-trace contains nested P-traces with explicit
   call/return points.  Defer to Phase 12-followup or Phase 13.

4. **Schedule semantics**: if Q's adversary can adaptively schedule
   per-instance actions (e.g., delay AVSS_2 until learning AVSS_1's
   view), the conditional-independence argument needs care.  The
   right model is probably: the adversary controls Q's schedule and
   per-step picks one subprotocol-instance to advance.

### 15.5. Sequence in the master plan

  Phase 12-θ              — cleanup
```

### 15.6. Alternative: shortcut path

If random secret draw is the *only* compositional protocol we need,
the principled Phase 12 layer is overkill.  The shortcut is:

  * Formalise random secret draw directly as a `ProbActionSpec`.
  * Prove its secrecy *inline*, treating AVSS's per-instance secrecy
    as a library lemma (call site of `avss_secrecy_AS_view_rushing_instance`
    from Phase 11-γ).
  * No `SubprotocolFunctionality` abstraction, no composition operator.

Estimated cost: ~500 LOC for the random secret draw protocol +
specific secrecy proof.

The principled Phase 12 path costs ~1180 LOC but amortises across
future protocols (each new compositional protocol becomes ~150-200
LOC instead of ~500 LOC).

**Decision criterion**: if 3+ compositional protocols are planned,
go principled.  If random secret draw is one-off, shortcut.

### 15.7. Maintenance protocol

Same as §13.8: each Phase 12 sub-PR's commit message updates
§15.2's table from ⏳ pending to ✅ landed.  After Phase 12
completes, this section freezes as the canonical reference for
the composability layer.

## 16. CR '93 threshold and fairness audit

A reader who picks up the formalised theorems may reasonably ask:
"under what assumptions on `n` and `t` are these claims meaningful?"
Most headline theorems carry only `corr.card ≤ t` as their threshold
hypothesis.  Phase 8.6-redux adds an explicit `3 * t + 1 ≤ n`
self-documentation hypothesis to the four existential-commitment
headlines, but the current proofs do not consume it.  The preamble of
`AVSS.lean` claims "`n ≥ 3t + 1`" as the model's intended setting; this
section audits where the actual bounds sit and how the formalisation
relates to Canetti–Rabin '93's stated threat model.

### 16.1. Threshold bounds — what's enforced vs claimed

| Bound | Status in code | Where it appears |
|---|---|---|
| `corr.card ≤ t` | ✅ enforced as theorem hypothesis | All headline theorems take `h_corr : corr.card ≤ t` |
| `n ≥ 2t + 1` (so `n - t ≥ t + 1`) | ⚠️ implicit | Used silently when `n - t` is required to dominate `t + 1` (e.g., honest-output quorum existence in `consistent_quorum_AE_of_all_honest_delivered` cardinality argument) |
| `n ≥ 3t + 1` (Bracha echo-quorum intersection) | ⚠️ partially explicit | The four existential-commitment headlines now carry `3 * t + 1 ≤ n` as a self-documenting hypothesis.  `quorum_intersection_card` (§16 of `AVSS.lean`) carries the bound information but is still **defined-but-never-used** — no proof consumes it yet |
| `n ≥ 4t + 1` (Bracha-quality intersection: `≥ t+1` honest in any two output-quorums) | ❌ not enforced | Quorum-intersection lemma's docstring mentions it as a stronger setting; not actually used |

**Interpretation.**  The headline theorems are mathematically valid
under the weakest standing hypothesis (`corr.card ≤ t`), but their
*cryptographic content* is non-vacuous only under `n ≥ 3t + 1` —
because under weaker bounds, the runtime hypothesis `consistent_quorum_AE`
(see §16.3) becomes unsatisfiable in the actual Bracha-amplified
protocol semantics.

This is **not a soundness bug**: the theorems are honestly stated as
"if these runtime hypotheses are satisfied, then …".  But the
**discharge** of those runtime hypotheses (in particular
`consistent_quorum_AE`) is what requires `n ≥ 3t + 1`, and we don't
formalise the discharge — see §16.4.

### 16.2. Fairness predicate — `avssFair` vs CR '93 weak fairness

`avssFair : FairnessAssumptions` (AVSS.lean §11) defines the fair
action set as every action **except** corrupt-fired sends:

```
avssFairActions = { dealerShareTo p, partyDeliver p, partyEchoSend p,
                    partyEchoReceive p q, partyReady p, partyAmplify p,
                    partyReceiveReady p q, partyOutput p }
                  -- corrupt-fired sends NOT fair
```

with `isWeaklyFair := fun _ => True` (every fair action is weakly
fair-required to fire).

This matches CR '93's standard async fairness assumption: every
honest-party-initiated action eventually fires, every sent message
is eventually delivered.  Corrupt-fired sends are NOT fair because
the adversary chooses their schedule.

**Verdict**: `avssFair` is faithful to CR '93's weak fairness.

### 16.3. The `consistent_quorum_AE` runtime hypothesis

Phase 8.5d-γ (PR #70) re-scoped `avss_termination_AS_fair` to take
an extra runtime hypothesis:

```
def consistent_quorum_AE ... (A : Adversary ...) : Prop :=
  ∀ᵐ ω ∂(traceDist (avssSpec ...) A μ₀),
    ∃ k₀ : ℕ, ∀ k ≥ k₀,
      |{p ∉ corr ∧ ω k.dealerSent p ∧ ω k.dealerMessages p ≠ none}| ≥ n - t
```

In words: AE on traces, eventually at least `n - t` honest parties
have received their dealer share.

**Why we add this.**  Phase 8.5d-α split the dealer's broadcast into
per-party `dealerShareTo p` actions (closing caveat C4 — selective
non-broadcast).  Under that model, a corrupt dealer can selectively
refuse to send to some honest parties, blocking their output and
breaking termination unconditionally.

**CR '93's contrast.**  The original CR '93 protocol assumes the
dealer broadcasts a single message to all parties (atomic
broadcast).  Under that assumption, `consistent_quorum_AE` is
**derivable** from broadcast atomicity + `avssFair`'s weak-
delivery — no extra hypothesis needed.

**Verdict**: `consistent_quorum_AE` is **strictly extra** relative
to CR '93's stated threat model.  It's a runtime hypothesis our
formalisation needs because we model the more permissive selective-
non-broadcast adversary.  Under CR '93's atomic-broadcast model,
it would be a theorem, not a hypothesis.

The sanity-check lemma `consistent_quorum_AE_of_all_honest_delivered`
shows the form is satisfiable: under any schedule that AE delivers
to every honest party, the consistent-quorum hypothesis holds.

### 16.4. Bracha amplification gap

CR '93's protocol uses Bracha-style echo+ready amplification to
guarantee that **if any honest party outputs, then all honest
parties eventually output** (the "any-or-all" property).  The
amplification argument is:

  1. Output requires `readyReceived.card ≥ n - t`.
  2. Among `n - t` ready-senders, at least `n - t - t = n - 2t` are
     honest (since at most `t` are corrupt).
  3. Each of those honest ready-senders satisfies the `partyAmplify`
     gate (`readyReceived ≥ t + 1`), which forces every other honest
     party with `readyReceived ≥ t + 1` to also send ready.
  4. Cascade: once one honest party outputs, every honest party
     eventually has `readyReceived.card ≥ n - t` and outputs.

This argument requires `n ≥ 3t + 1` for the intersection step (so
that any two ready-quorums of size `n - t` share at least one honest
party).  **We do not formalise this argument.**  Instead, the
termination certificate `avssCert` (§12 of AVSS.lean) takes
`consistent_quorum_AE` as a hypothesis and produces termination from
there.

**Status**: this is a known formalisation simplification.  CR '93's
core "any-or-all" property is the missing piece.  Closing it would
require a substantive PR (~150–250 LOC) proving:

  ```
  theorem avss_any_or_all
      (h_corr : corr.card ≤ t) (h_n_geq : 3 * t + 1 ≤ n)
      ... :
    AlmostBox ... (fun s =>
      (∃ p ∉ s.corrupted, (s.local_ p).output.isSome) →
      ∀ᵐ ω ..., ∃ k₀, ∀ k ≥ k₀, ∀ p ∉ corr,
        (ω k).1.local_ p .output.isSome)
  ```

Once proven, `consistent_quorum_AE` could be discharged from
`avss_any_or_all` + dealer-broadcast + `avssFair`, recovering CR
'93's unconditional fair-AST claim.

### 16.5. Net assessment relative to CR '93

| CR '93 claim | Our formalisation |
|---|---|
| **Threat model**: `n ≥ 3t + 1`, byzantine static corruption ≤ `t` | Static corruption ✅; threshold bound **claimed but not enforced** |
| **Fairness**: weak fairness (every fair action eventually fires) | ✅ via `avssFair` |
| **Termination**: every honest party eventually outputs | ✅ conditional on `consistent_quorum_AE` (which CR '93 derives from broadcast + fairness; we leave as runtime hypothesis) |
| **Correctness** (honest dealer): every honest output equals `bivEval coeffs (partyPoint p) 0` | ✅ existential-witness form |
| **Commitment** (corrupt dealer): all honest outputs jointly determined | ❌ **honest-dealer-conditional** after Phase 8.5d-β; Phase 8.6 (Bracha amplification) **deferred indefinitely** after three attempts (see §12.6 final disposition).  Accepted as the formalisation's bound on commitment. |
| **Secrecy**: `t`-coalition view independent of secret | ✅ operational view, dealerHonest-INDEPENDENT |
| **Reconstruction**: `t + 1` honest shares recover the secret | ✅ as Lagrange lemma (not a protocol phase) |
| **Bracha "any-or-all"** amplification | ❌ not formalised; replaced by `consistent_quorum_AE` runtime hypothesis |
| **Adaptive corruption** | ❌ static only; gap |
| **Dealer broadcast** (atomic) | ⚠️ permissive: per-party `dealerShareTo p` actions; closes caveat C4 but introduces `consistent_quorum_AE` hypothesis |

**Verdict**: **CR '93 property parity for honest-dealer-conditional commitment**, with three accepted structural gaps:

  1. **Corrupt-dealer commitment** (§12.6) — Phase 8.6 deferred
     indefinitely after three attempts.  The post-C1+C2 model
     (corrupt-fire freedom on send actions, Phase 8.5b) interacts
     non-trivially with the value-bearing echoes that Bracha
     amplification requires.  Accepted as the formalisation's bound
     on commitment.  The current `_existential` form (post-Fix 1)
     is honest about its content.

  2. **Bracha "any-or-all" amplification** (§16.4) — replaced by
     `consistent_quorum_AE` runtime hypothesis.  Closing this would
     also let us drop the `consistent_quorum_AE` hypothesis on
     `avss_termination_AS_fair`, recovering CR '93's unconditional
     fair-AST.  Independent of the Phase 8.6 obstruction (does not
     require value-bearing echoes).

  3. **Adaptive corruption** — our model is static; CR '93 is
     adaptive.  Closing this requires substantial state surgery
     (~600–1000 LOC) and is a known modern-formalisation
     simplification.

The threshold bound `n ≥ 3t + 1` is now explicit on the four
existential-commitment headlines, but not yet load-bearing.  The next
faithfulness step is to make this hypothesis operational by consuming
`quorum_intersection_card` in the value-validation and any-or-all
proofs, rather than carrying the bound only as documentation.

### 16.6. Recommended follow-ups (queued)

| # | Follow-up | Scope | LOC | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **16-α** | Add `n ≥ 3 * t + 1` hypothesis to the four existential-commitment headlines for self-documentation | Light-touch, signature surgery | ~20 | ✅ landed in Phase 8.6-redux |
| **16-β** | Formalise Bracha "any-or-all" amplification → discharge `consistent_quorum_AE` from `avssFair` + broadcast | Substantive; **independent of Phase 8.6 obstruction** (does not require value-bearing echoes) | ~150–250 | queued |
| **16-γ** | Adaptive corruption support | Substantial state surgery | ~600–1000 | queued |
| ~~Phase 8.6 / corrupt-dealer commitment~~ | (originally queued) | (originally ~200–400; revised to ~2386–3186 after empirical analysis) | **❌ deferred indefinitely** — see §12.6 final disposition |

## 17. Roadmap to a literature-faithful AVSS model

Phase 8.6-redux revisited the current `AVSS.lean` model against the
Canetti–Rabin AVSS story at a higher level.  The conclusion is that
the current `avssSpec` should be treated as a threshold-faithful
operational skeleton, not as the final CR-faithful verified-sharing
protocol.

The model has the right high-level asynchronous structure: per-party
dealer delivery, bivariate row/column payload carriers, echo/ready/
amplify thresholds, rushing adversaries, randomised adversaries, and
row/column bivariate secrecy facts.  The missing operational mechanism
is the verification path itself: echoes and readies currently carry
only sender identities.  They do not carry payload values, row/column
evaluations, or certificates that a receiver can compare against its
own column polynomial.

This is why corrupt-dealer commitment cannot be recovered by proof
engineering alone.  In the current sender-only echo model, a corrupt
dealer can choose inconsistent `dealerCommit p .rowPoly` values for
honest parties; honest parties can still accumulate sender-count
quorums and output `evalRowPoly rp 0` from their own delivered row.
No gate forces the resulting honest outputs to lie on one degree-`≤ t`
polynomial.

### 17.1. Current fidelity classification

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Static corruption | ✅ formalised | CR '93 is adaptive; static corruption remains a known simplification |
| Async trace model | ✅ formalised | `traceDist`, rushing and randomised adversary layers are substantial |
| Threshold skeleton | ✅ formalised | `n - t` echo/ready/output gates and `t + 1` amplify gate are present |
| Bivariate payload carrier | ⚠️ partial | `DealerPayload` has row and column fields, but `colPoly` is operationally unused |
| Verification messages | ❌ missing | Echo/ready messages carry sender IDs only, not values/certificates |
| Corrupt-dealer commitment | ❌ not true for current `avssSpec` | The honest-dealer guard is structural, not merely a missing proof |
| Any-or-all amplification | ❌ not formalised | Replaced by `consistent_quorum_AE`; see §16.4 |
| Fairness | ⚠️ partial | Current trajectory progress is label-level; CR fairness is enabled-message / honest-action fairness |

### 17.2. Recommended architecture

Do not mutate `avssSpec` in place.  It is useful as a stable proof
platform and regression baseline.  Add a new CR-faithful specification,
for example `AVSSFaithful.lean`, with a separate state/action family:

1. **Dealer payloads are real row+column payloads.**  Honest dealer
   initialisation should set both `rowPolyOfDealer` and
   `colPolyOfDealer`.  Corrupt dealer initialisation may choose
   arbitrary per-party row/column pairs.

2. **Messages carry verification content.**  Echo messages should
   record the relevant value/certificate, not just the sender.  The
   natural CR-style primitive is a cross-check value such as
   `row_q (partyPoint p)` together with the receiver-side comparison
   against `col_p (partyPoint q)`.

3. **Local state stores validated evidence, not only sender sets.**
   Replace `echoesReceived : Finset (Fin n)` with a structure keyed by
   candidate payload/value/certificate.  Threshold gates should count
   senders supporting the same validated candidate.

4. **Ready messages should be candidate/certificate-scoped.**  A
   receiver should output only after collecting an `n - t` ready quorum
   for a single candidate, not merely any `n - t` ready senders.

5. **Commitment proof consumes quorum intersection.**  The proof route
   should use `quorum_intersection_card` and the validated-candidate
   invariant to show any two honest output certificates agree on enough
   honest evaluation points to force one degree-`≤ t` reconstruction.

6. **Secrecy proof becomes distributional at the value layer.**  Prior
   Phase 8.6 attempts failed because value-bearing honest messages are
   secret-dependent across two simulation traces.  A faithful model
   should not try to maintain pointwise equality for these fields in
   `simSyncInv`; it should expose a projection whose distribution is
   handled by the existing bivariate Shamir row+column secrecy theorems.

### 17.3. Suggested PR chain

1. **Spec skeleton PR.**  Add `AVSSFaithful.lean` with state/action
   types, payload/candidate/certificate data structures, finite and
   measurable instances, and no major proofs beyond frame lemmas.
   **Status:** implemented in Phase 8.6-redux as
   `Leslie/Examples/Prob/AVSSFaithful.lean`; imported by
   `Leslie/Prob/Index.lean`.

2. **Operational invariants PR.**  Prove queue freshness, validated
   echo/ready preservation, and candidate-scoped threshold invariants.

3. **Commitment PR.**  Prove corrupt-dealer commitment for the faithful
   spec using candidate-scoped ready quorums plus `quorum_intersection_card`.

4. **Fairness/termination PR.**  Replace `consistent_quorum_AE` with a
   CR-style delivery/fairness theorem for the faithful spec, or make the
   required broadcast/delivery assumption explicit and local to the new
   spec.

5. **Secrecy PR.**  Rebuild the operational secrecy theorem for the
   faithful spec using distributional bivariate row+column secrecy
   rather than pointwise equality of value-bearing honest messages.

This route avoids repeating the three failed Phase 8.6 attempts: it
does not add secret-dependent value fields to the existing
`simSyncInv` and then try to prove pointwise equality; it instead
builds a spec whose commitment theorem is true operationally and a
secrecy proof architecture that treats value-bearing observations as
joint distributions.
