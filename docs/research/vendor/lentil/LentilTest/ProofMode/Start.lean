/- Tests for the `tla_start` tactic.

   `tla_start` reshapes a goal of the form `(prem₁ ∧ … ∧ premₙ) |-tla- goal`
   into the `Entails [h₁ : prem₁, …, hₙ : premₙ] goal` proof-mode view, with
   the user supplying one name per premise. The list of premises is obtained
   by `splitAndIntoParts`, which treats the conjunction associatively; but the
   `change`-step assumes the premises are right-associated (since `Entails`
   reconstructs them via `foldrD tla_and tla_true`).
