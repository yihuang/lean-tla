Design notes.

`tla_rewrite` operates on selected pieces of a proof-mode sequent

  `Entails [⟨h₀, p₀⟩, ..., ⟨hₙ, pₙ⟩] goal`.

The first implementation tried to change the goal to a wrapper whose selected
locations were explicit arguments and whose unselected locations were implicit
arguments. That does not isolate the unselected predicates: Lean's `rewrite`
still traverses implicit arguments, so a rewrite intended for `hp₁ hp₃` could
also rewrite `hp₂`.

The current implementation instead follows the shape of the manual script

  `let cont := fun preds => EntailsWithSomePredsExtractedOut hyps idxs preds goal`
  `change cont [selected predicates]`
  `rewrite ...`
  `revert cont`
  `change Entails [updated hypotheses] updatedGoal`

for one selected location at a time. An earlier version exposed all selected
hypotheses together as one list argument, but that did not match Lean's
`rewrite` location semantics: Lean rewrites each selected hypothesis separately,
so `rewrite [h] at *` can rewrite both `hp` and `hr` even if `hq` has no
matching occurrence. Rewriting the whole selected list only rewrites the first
matching occurrence in that list.

If the goal itself is selected, `cont` takes a second explicit argument for it.
The body of the local `let` is opaque to `rewrite`, while the explicit argument
for the current location remains a normal Lean expression. After rewriting,
reverting and unfolding `cont` restores a literal `Entails` target with the
original hypothesis order and names. The final target is computed here at the
meta level; we do not rely on `dsimp` to clean up `replacePredsAtIndices`.

`tla_simp` and `tla_dsimp` deliberately do not use this helper. They are
implemented as direct `conv` visits to the selected expressions because
simplification does not need `rewrite`'s theorem-premise side-goal behavior.

`tla_rewrite [rules]` rewrites predicates in a proof-mode goal or selected
proof-mode hypotheses.

With no location, it rewrites the goal predicate. For example, if the goal is
`q` and `heq : q = r`, then
```lean
tla_rewrite [heq]
```
changes the goal to `r`.

Locations use Lean's location syntax, but refer to proof-mode hypotheses:
```lean
tla_rewrite [heq] at hp
tla_rewrite [← heq] at hp hq ⊢
```
The first rewrites only `hp`; the second rewrites `hp`, `hq`, and the goal.
With `at *`, each proof-mode hypothesis and the goal are considered separately;
locations that do not contain a matching occurrence are skipped as in Lean's
`rewrite`.
